generate an explanation (that ai reader will read, which will act as  a professor, he actually dont know anything, but with your impressive expression and explanatinon for each slide he will be, i will use the generated explanation to listen while watching the slides),
for images, tables, figures and diagrams, explain them directly, (dont write them as tables or diagrams, as ai will struggle reading them) for each thing you write think twice how it will be convenient to be a content professional professor would say (not reading or studying) to teach or lecture the students
ai model needs stops, and pancatuitions that will make his tone good while explaining,
he must explain slide by slide as a very professional professor, the ai model  reader cant decide what and what not to read, so u must provide the final readable text (aslo while keep formatting markdown content as it will not hurt the reading style), 
make sure definitions are surrounded by `` and format document well, 

also make sure to follow our formatting rules

give me first half of the slides, and then  I will ask you to give me the other half

consider following as example from other chapter

# Databases and Database Users


# FUNDAMENTALS OF DATABASE SYSTEMS, 7th Edition, by Elmasri and Navathe

Welcome, everyone, to our course on the Fundamentals of Database Systems. We are using the seventh edition of the textbook by Elmasri and Navathe. This book, as you see on the cover, is a cornerstone in understanding how data is managed in modern computing. The imagery itself, those layered rock formations, perhaps subtly hints at the structured, layered, and foundational nature of database systems. Let's begin our journey.

# CHAPTER 1: Databases and Database Users

Our first chapter, Chapter 1, is titled "Databases and Database Users." This chapter will serve as our introduction to the entire field. We'll define what databases are, explore who uses them, and understand why they are so critical in today's world. Think of this as laying the groundwork... the essential vocabulary and concepts upon which everything else will be built.

<div class="page-break"></div>

### OUTLINE

So, what exactly will we cover in this introductory chapter? Let's look at the outline.

First, we'll discuss **Types of Databases and Database Applications**. You'll see that databases come in many flavors and serve a vast array of purposes.
Then, we'll establish some **Basic Definitions** – key terms you'll hear repeatedly.
We'll move on to **Typical DBMS Functionality**. DBMS stands for Database Management System, and we'll explore what these systems actually *do*.
To make things more concrete, we'll look at an **Example of a Database**, specifically a UNIVERSITY database. This will help illustrate the concepts.
A very important section will be on the **Main Characteristics of the Database Approach**. Why choose this approach over older methods?
We'll then categorize the **Types of Database Users**. Who are the people interacting with these systems?
Following that, we'll summarize the **Advantages of Using the Database Approach**.
We'll also take a brief look at the **Historical Development of Database Technology** to understand how we got here.
We'll touch upon **Extending Database Capabilities** – how databases are evolving.
And finally, we'll consider **When Not to Use Databases**. Yes, there are situations where a full-fledged database system might be overkill.

A comprehensive overview, indeed. Let's proceed.

### What is data, database, DBMS

Let's start with the absolute fundamentals. What are we even talking about?

First, **`Data`**. Data simply refers to known facts that can be recorded and have an implicit meaning. Think of it as raw material – names, numbers, dates, images. For example, "John Smith," the number "35," or a picture of a product.

Next, a **`Database`**. A database is a highly organized, interrelated, and structured set of data about a particular enterprise. The key words here are "organized," "interrelated," and "structured." It's not just a random collection of data; it’s data that’s meaningfully connected and arranged. And very importantly, a database is typically controlled by a **database management system**, or **DBMS**.

So, what is a **DBMS**? A DBMS is a set of programs designed to access the data. It provides an environment that is both *convenient* and *efficient* to use. It's the software that sits between the users (or applications) and the actual data, managing all interactions.

Database systems, then, are used to manage collections of data that are typically:
*   **`Highly valuable`** – think of financial records, customer information, or scientific research.
*   **`Relatively large*`* – we're often dealing with vast amounts of information.
*   And **accessed by multiple users and applications, often at the same time**. This concurrency aspect is crucial.

A modern database system, therefore, is a complex software system. Its primary task is to manage a large, complex collection of data. And make no mistake, databases touch all aspects of our lives, from online shopping to social media, to how organizations run.
