Please convert the provided content into well-formatted Markdown. Adhere strictly to the following guidelines:

**I. Core Principle:**
*   **Preserve Exact Content:** The wording and substance of the original content must be preserved. Only reformat the presentation.

**II. General Markdown Formatting:**
*   **Comprehensive Markdown Usage:** Utilize all appropriate Markdown features to enhance clarity and structure. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   Headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.)
    *   Lists (ordered and unordered, with proper indentation for sub-items)
    *   Bold (`**text**`) and Italics (`*text*`) for emphasis, key terms (e.g., **Define**, *meta-data*), or as seen in the source.
    *   Code blocks (``` ```) for code snippets or pre-formatted text.
    *   for definitions or key terms, use backticks (`` `term` ``) to denote them clearly.
*   **Header Consolidation:**
    *   Avoid redundant headers. If a main section heading is already present, do not repeat it if subsequent "slides" in the source use the same or very similar title.
    *   If multiple short, related "slides" can be logically grouped, combine them under a single, more general heading (e.g., use "Recent Developments" to cover two distinct but related slides).
    *   If a diagram or concept is referenced across "slides" with slightly different titles (e.g., "A simplified architecture for a database system" vs. "A simplified database system environment"), use the most descriptive title or the first one encountered for that recurring element.

**III. Structural Elements:**
*   **Page Breaks:** Insert `\n --- \n <div class="page-break"></div>` after each main section or logical grouping of content that signifies a new "page" or a significant shift in topic.
*   **Horizontal Rules:** Use `---` to separate distinct content blocks within a larger section where a full page break is not appropriate but a visual separation is beneficial.

**IV. Table Formatting:**
*   **Markdown Tables:** All tabular data must be formatted as Markdown tables.
*   **Table Cohesion:** If a table logically spans multiple "slides" in the source, represent it as a single, unified Markdown table.
*   **Forced Table Breaks:** If a single logical table is explicitly broken across "slides" in the source (e.g., due to its size on the original slide), and cannot be reasonably combined into one Markdown table without losing clarity or context from the source's presentation, insert a `<div class="page-break"></div>` between the constituent parts of the table.
*   **Titles/Captions:** Clearly include any table titles or captions provided in the source (e.g., "Figure 1.2 A database that stores student and course information.") above the respective table.

**V. Image and Figure Handling:**
*   **Placeholders Only:** For all images, figures, and diagrams, insert an empty Markdown image tag. If the source provides a caption or figure number (e.g., "Figure 1.2: System Architecture"), use that as the alt text. Otherwise, use a generic placeholder.
    *   Example with caption: `![Figure 1.2: System Architecture]()`
    *   Example without caption: `![Image Placeholder]()`
*   **No Image Content:** Do not attempt to describe or embed images. I will replace these placeholders manually.

**VI. Exclusions:**
*   **No Copyright Information:** Do not include any copyright notices.
*   **No Headers/Footers:** Omit all page numbers, slide numbers, or any other footer/header information originating from the source document.

**VII. Output Delivery:**
*   **Message Splitting:** If the generated Markdown content is extensive, provide it in split messages. I will explicitly request "next part" or similar. The maximum length per message is 65,536 characters. Ensure logical break points between messages (e.g., at the end of a section or before a page break).

**Goal:** The final output should be a clean, well-structured, and visually informative Markdown document that accurately reflects the source content, ready for further use.
