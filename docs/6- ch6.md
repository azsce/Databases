<div class="page-break"></div>

## Basic SQL

*   **`SQL language`**
    *   Considered one of the major reasons for the commercial success of relational databases
*   **`SQL`**
    *   The origin of SQL is relational predicate calculus called tuple calculus (see Ch.8) which was proposed initially as the language SQUARE (Specifying Queries as Relational Expressions).
    *   SQL Actually comes from the word "SEQUEL" (Structured English Query Language) which was the original term used in the paper: “SEQUEL TO SQUARE" by Chamberlin and Boyce. IBM could not copyright that term, so they abbreviated to SQL and copyrighted the term SQL.
    *   Now popularly known as "Structured Query Language”.

<div class="page-break"></div>

## SQL Data Definition, Data Types, Standards

*   **Terminology:**
    *   **`Table, row,`** and **`column`** used for relational model terms relation, tuple, and attribute
    *   The language has features for : Data definition, Data Manipulation, Transaction control (Transact-SQL, Ch. 20), Indexing (Ch.17), Security specification (Grant and Revoke- see Ch.30), Active databases (Ch.26), Multi-media (Ch.26), Distributed databases (Ch.23) etc.
*   **`CREATE statement`**
    *   Main SQL command for data definition

---

## Schema and Catalog Concepts in SQL

*   Variations in existing RDBMS systems
*   **`SQL schema`**
    *   Identified by a **schema name**
    *   Includes an **authorization identifier** and **descriptors** for each element
*   **`Schema elements`** include
    *   Tables, constraints, views, domains, and other constructs
*   Each statement in SQL ends with a **semicolon**
*   **`CREATE SCHEMA statement`**
    *   `CREATE SCHEMA COMPANY AUTHORIZATION 'Jsmith';`
*   **`Catalog`**
    *   Named collection of schemas in an SQL environment
    *   SQL also has the concept of a cluster of catalogs.

---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## The CREATE TABLE Command in SQL

*   **Specifying a new relation**
    *   Provide name of table
    *   Specify attributes, their types and initial constraints
*   **Can optionally specify schema:**
    *   `CREATE TABLE COMPANY.EMPLOYEE ...`
    *   or
    *   `CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE ...`

---

### The CREATE TABLE Command in SQL (cont'd.)

*   **`Base tables` (base relations)**
    *   Relation and its tuples are actually created and stored as a file by the DBMS
*   **`Virtual relations` (views)**
    *   Created through the `CREATE VIEW` statement.
    *   Do not correspond to any physical file.

## Attribute Data Types and Domains in SQL

*   **Basic data types**
    *   **Numeric data types**
        *   Integer numbers: `INTEGER`, `INT`, and `SMALLINT`
        *   Floating-point (real) numbers: `FLOAT` or `REAL`, and `DOUBLE PRECISION`

    | Data Type          | Storage | Precision                        | Use Case                                  |
    | :----------------- | :------ | :------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
    | `SMALLINT`         | 2 bytes | Whole numbers (-32,768 to 32,767)  | Best for small values                     |
    | `INTEGER` / `INT`  | 4 bytes | Whole numbers (-2 billion to 2 billion) | General use                             |
    | `REAL` / `FLOAT`   | 4 bytes | Approx. 6-7 decimal digits       | When small floating-point values are enough |
    | `DOUBLE PRECISION` | 8 bytes | Approx. 15-16 decimal digits     | When high accuracy is needed              |

---

*   **Basic data types (cont'd)**
    *   **Character-string data types**
        *   Fixed length: `CHAR(n)`, `CHARACTER(n)`
        *   Varying length: `VARCHAR(n)`, `CHAR VARYING(n)`, `CHARACTER VARYING(n)`

    | Data Type     | Storage  | Padding          | Use Case                                   |
    | :------------ | :------- | :--------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
    | `CHAR(n)`     | Fixed    | Yes (adds spaces) | Best for fixed-length fields like IDs, codes |
    | `VARCHAR(n)`  | Variable | No               | Best for variable-length text like names   |

---

### Attribute Data Types and Domains in SQL (cont'd.)

*   **Bit-string data types**
    *   Fixed length: `BIT(n)`
    *   Varying length: `BIT VARYING(n)`
    *   `BLOB` (Binary Large Object), `BLOB(10G)`
*   **Boolean data type**
    *   Values of `TRUE` or `FALSE` or `NULL`
*   **DATE data type**
    *   Ten positions
    *   Components are `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `DAY` in the form YYYY-MM-DD
    *   Multiple mapping functions available in RDBMSs to change date formats

---

### Attribute Data Types and Domains in SQL (cont'd.)

*   **Additional data types**
    *   **Timestamp data type**
        *   Includes the `DATE` and `TIME` fields
        *   Plus a minimum of six positions for decimal fractions of seconds
        *   Optional `WITH TIME ZONE` qualifier
*   `DATE`, `TIME`, `Timestamp`, `INTERVAL` data types can be **cast** or converted to string formats for comparison.

---

### Attribute Data Types and Domains in SQL (cont'd.)

*   **Domain**
    *   Name used with the attribute specification
    *   Makes it easier to change the data type for a domain that is used by numerous attributes
    *   Improves schema readability
    *   Example:
        *   `CREATE DOMAIN SSN_TYPE AS CHAR(9);`
*   **TYPE**
    *   User Defined Types (UDTs) are supported for object-oriented applications. (See Ch.12) Uses the command: `CREATE TYPE`

---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Specifying Constraints in SQL

**Basic constraints:**
*   Relational Model has 3 basic constraint types that are supported in SQL:
    *   **Key constraint**: A primary key value cannot be duplicated
    *   **Entity Integrity constraint**: A primary key value cannot be null
    *   **Referential integrity constraints**: The "foreign key “must have a value that is already present as a primary key, or may be null.

---

### Specifying Attribute Constraints

**Other Restrictions on attribute domains:**
*   **Default value** of an attribute
    *   `DEFAULT <value>`
*   **NULL is not permitted** for a particular attribute (`NOT NULL`)
*   **CHECK clause**
    *   `Dnumber INT NOT NULL CHECK (Dnumber > 0 AND Dnumber < 21);`
    *   Restrict to numbers 1-20

---

### Specifying Key and Referential Integrity Constraints

*   **PRIMARY KEY clause**
    *   Specifies one or more attributes that make up the primary key of a relation
    *   `Dnumber INT PRIMARY KEY;`
*   **UNIQUE clause**
    *   Specifies alternate (secondary) keys (called CANDIDATE keys in the relational model).
    *   `Dname VARCHAR(15) UNIQUE;`

---

### Specifying Key and Referential Integrity Constraints (cont'd.)

*   **FOREIGN KEY clause**
    *   Default operation: reject update on violation
    *   Attach **referential triggered action** clause
        *   Options include `SET NULL`, `CASCADE`, and `SET DEFAULT`
        *   Action taken by the DBMS for `SET NULL` or `SET DEFAULT` is the same for both `ON DELETE` and `ON UPDATE`
        *   `CASCADE` option suitable for "relationship" relations

---

### Giving Names to Constraints

*   Using the Keyword `CONSTRAINT`
    *   Name a constraint (unique name)
    *   Useful for later altering

---

### Default attribute values and referential integrity triggered action specification (Fig. 6.2)

```sql
CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE
(
--     ...,
    Dno INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    CONSTRAINT EMPPK
        PRIMARY KEY (Ssn),
    CONSTRAINT EMPSUPERFK
        FOREIGN KEY (Super_ssn) REFERENCES EMPLOYEE (Ssn)
            ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE,
    CONSTRAINT EMPDEPTFK
        FOREIGN KEY (Dno) REFERENCES DEPARTMENT (Dnumber)
            ON DELETE SET DEFAULT ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE DEPARTMENT
(
--     ...,
    Mgr_ssn CHAR(9) NOT NULL DEFAULT '888665555',
--     ...,
    CONSTRAINT DEPTPK
        PRIMARY KEY (Dnumber),
    CONSTRAINT DEPTSK
        UNIQUE (Dname),
    CONSTRAINT DEPTMGRFK
        FOREIGN KEY (Mgr_ssn) REFERENCES EMPLOYEE (Ssn)
            ON DELETE SET DEFAULT ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE DEPT_LOCATIONS
(
--     ...,
    PRIMARY KEY (Dnumber, Dlocation),
    FOREIGN KEY (Dnumber) REFERENCES DEPARTMENT (Dnumber)
        ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);
```

---

### Specifying Constraints on Tuples Using CHECK

*   Additional Constraints on individual tuples within a relation are also possible using `CHECK`
*   `CHECK` clauses at the end of a `CREATE TABLE` statement
    *   Apply to each tuple individually
    *   A manager's starting date should be after a department's creation
    *   `CHECK (Dept_create_date <= Mgr_start_date);`

---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Basic Retrieval Queries in SQL

*   **`SELECT` statement**
    *   One basic statement for retrieving information from a database
*   SQL allows a table to have two or more tuples that are identical in all their attribute values
    *   Unlike relational model (relational model is strictly set-theory based)
    *   Multiset or bag behavior

---

### The SELECT-FROM-WHERE Structure of Basic SQL Queries

*   **Basic form of the `SELECT` statement:**

    ```sql
    SELECT <attribute list>
    FROM   <table list>
    WHERE  <condition>;
    ```
    where
    *   `<attribute list>` is a list of attribute names whose values are to be retrieved by the query.
    *   `<table list>` is a list of the relation names required to process the query.
    *   `<condition>` is a conditional (Boolean) expression that identifies the tuples to be retrieved by the query.

---

### The SELECT-FROM-WHERE Structure of Basic SQL Queries (cont'd.)

*   **Logical comparison operators**
    *   `=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, and `<>`
*   **Projection attributes**
    *   Attributes whose values are to be retrieved
*   **Selection condition**
    *   Boolean condition that must be true for any retrieved tuple. Selection conditions include join conditions (see Ch.8) when multiple relations are involved.

---

### Basic Retrieval Queries

*(Result of Query 0)*
| Bdate      | Address                  |
| :--------- | :----------------------- |
| 1965-01-09 | 731 Fondren, Houston, TX |

**Query 0.** Retrieve the birth date and address of the employee(s) whose name is 'John B. Smith'.
```sql
Q0: SELECT Bdate, Address
    FROM   EMPLOYEE
    WHERE  Fname='John' AND Minit='B' AND Lname='Smith';
```

*(Sample result of Query 1 - assuming data from Fig 5.6)*
| Fname    | Lname   | Address                  |
| :------- | :------ | :----------------------- |
| John     | Smith   | 731 Fondren, Houston, TX |
| Franklin | Wong    | 638 Voss, Houston, TX    |
| Ramesh   | Narayan | 975 Fire Oak, Humble, TX |
| Joyce    | English | 5631 Rice, Houston, TX   |

**Query 1.** Retrieve the name and address of all employees who work for the 'Research' department.
```sql
Q1: SELECT Fname, Lname, Address
    FROM   EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT
    WHERE  Dname='Research' AND Dnumber=Dno;
```

---

### Basic Retrieval Queries (Contd.)

*(Result of Query 2 based on sample data)*
| Pnumber | Dnum | Lname   | Address               | Bdate      |
| :------ | :--- | :------ | :-------------------- | :--------- |
| 10      | 4    | Wallace | 291 Berry, Bellaire, TX | 1941-06-20 |
| 30      | 4    | Wallace | 291 Berry, Bellaire, TX | 1941-06-20 |

**Query 2.** For every project located in 'Stafford', list the project number, the controlling department number, and the department manager's last name, address, and birth date.
```sql
Q2: SELECT Pnumber, Dnum, Lname, Address, Bdate
    FROM   PROJECT, DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE
    WHERE  Dnum=Dnumber AND Mgr_ssn=Ssn AND
           Plocation='Stafford';
```

---

### Ambiguous Attribute Names

*   Same name can be used for two (or more) attributes in different relations
    *   As long as the attributes are in different relations
    *   Must **qualify** the attribute name with the relation name to prevent ambiguity

```sql
Q1A: SELECT Fname, EMPLOYEE.Name, Address /* Assuming EMPLOYEE table has a 'Name' attribute, 
                                             or this is a typo and meant Lname or similar.
                                             The schema in Fig 5.7 has Fname, Lname.
                                             DEPARTMENT has Dname.
                                             Let's assume EMPLOYEE.Name is illustrative for ambiguity.
                                             If it was DEPARTMENT.Name, it would be clearer.
                                             The example uses DEPARTMENT.Name in WHERE.
                                             Let's assume it's just showing qualification. */
     FROM   EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT
     WHERE  DEPARTMENT.Name='Research' AND /* Original says DEPARTMENT.Name, implies Dname */
            DEPARTMENT.Dnumber=EMPLOYEE.Dnumber; /* Original uses EMPLOYEE.Dnumber, implies Dno */
```
*(Note: The query Q1A as written on the slide has `EMPLOYEE.Name` in SELECT and `DEPARTMENT.Name` in WHERE, and `EMPLOYEE.Dnumber` in WHERE. Referring to Fig 5.7, `EMPLOYEE` has `Fname`, `Lname`, `Dno`. `DEPARTMENT` has `Dname`, `Dnumber`. A corrected Q1A for clarity would be:*
```sql
/* Corrected Q1A for consistency with Fig 5.7 schema: */
Q1A: SELECT E.Fname, E.Lname, E.Address
     FROM   EMPLOYEE E, DEPARTMENT D
     WHERE  D.Dname='Research' AND D.Dnumber=E.Dno;
```
*The slide intends to show how to qualify an attribute like `Name` if it existed in both tables, or `Dnumber` from `DEPARTMENT` vs `Dno` from `EMPLOYEE` if they had the same name.*
*The actual example shown:*
```sql
Q1A: SELECT Fname, EMPLOYEE.Name, Address 
     FROM   EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT 
     WHERE  DEPARTMENT.Name='Research' AND 
            DEPARTMENT.Dnumber=EMPLOYEE.Dnumber;
```
*Assuming `EMPLOYEE` has `Name` and `Dnumber` (which it doesn't per Fig 5.7, it has Dno), and `DEPARTMENT` has `Name` (likely `Dname`) and `Dnumber`.*
*For the purpose of the example about ambiguity, the slide used hypothetical or simplified names.*
*Original slide's `DEPARTMENT.Name` likely refers to `Dname`. `EMPLOYEE.Dnumber` likely refers to `Dno`.*

---

### Aliasing and Renaming

*   **Aliases** or **tuple variables**
    *   Declare alternative relation names E and S to refer to the EMPLOYEE relation twice in a query:

**Query 8.** For each employee, retrieve the employee's first and last name and the first and last name of his or her immediate supervisor.
```sql
SELECT E.Fname, E.Lname, S.Fname, S.Lname
FROM   EMPLOYEE AS E, EMPLOYEE AS S
WHERE  E.Super_ssn=S.Ssn;
```
*   Recommended practice to abbreviate names and to prefix same or similar attribute from multiple tables.

---

### Aliasing, Renaming and Tuple Variables (contd.)

*   The attribute names can also be renamed
    `EMPLOYEE AS E(Fn, Mi, Ln, Ssn, Bd, Addr, Sex, Sal, Sssn, Dno)`
*   Note that the relation EMPLOYEE now has a variable name E which corresponds to a tuple variable
*   The "AS" may be dropped in most SQL implementations

---

### Unspecified WHERE Clause and Use of the Asterisk

*   **Missing `WHERE` clause**
    *   Indicates no condition on tuple selection
*   Effect is a **`CROSS PRODUCT`**
    *   Result is all possible tuple combinations (or the Algebra operation of Cartesian Product–see Ch.8)

**Queries 9 and 10.** Select all EMPLOYEE Ssns (Q9) and all combinations of EMPLOYEE Ssn and DEPARTMENT Dname (Q10) in the database.
```sql
Q9:  SELECT Ssn
     FROM   EMPLOYEE;

Q10: SELECT Ssn, Dname
     FROM   EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT;
```

---

### Unspecified WHERE Clause and Use of the Asterisk (cont'd.)

*   **Specify an asterisk (*)**
    *   Retrieve all the attribute values of the selected tuples
    *   The `*` can be prefixed by the relation name; e.g., `EMPLOYEE.*`

```sql
Q1C:  SELECT *
      FROM   EMPLOYEE
      WHERE  Dno=5;

Q1D:  SELECT *
      FROM   EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT
      WHERE  Dname='Research' AND Dno=Dnumber;

Q10A: SELECT *
      FROM   EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT;
```

---

### Tables as Sets in SQL

*   SQL does not automatically eliminate duplicate tuples in query results
*   For aggregate operations (See sec 7.1.7) duplicates must be accounted for
*   Use the keyword `DISTINCT` in the `SELECT` clause
    *   Only distinct tuples should remain in the result

**Query 11.** Retrieve the salary of every employee (Q11) and all distinct salary values (Q11A).
```sql
Q11:  SELECT ALL Salary /* ALL is the default */
      FROM   EMPLOYEE;

Q11A: SELECT DISTINCT Salary
      FROM   EMPLOYEE;
```

---

### Tables as Sets in SQL (cont'd.)

*   **Set operations**
    *   `UNION`, `EXCEPT` (difference), `INTERSECT`
    *   Corresponding multiset operations: `UNION ALL`, `EXCEPT ALL`, `INTERSECT ALL`)
    *   Type compatibility is needed for these operations to be valid

**Query 4.** Make a list of all project numbers for projects that involve an employee whose last name is 'Smith', either as a worker or as a manager of the department that controls the project.
```sql
Q4A: (SELECT DISTINCT Pnumber
      FROM   PROJECT, DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE
      WHERE  Dnum=Dnumber AND Mgr_ssn=Ssn AND Lname='Smith')
     UNION
     (SELECT DISTINCT Pnumber /* Pno in WORKS_ON corresponds to Pnumber in PROJECT */
      FROM   PROJECT, WORKS_ON, EMPLOYEE
      WHERE  Pnumber=Pno AND Essn=Ssn AND Lname='Smith');
```

---

### Substring Pattern Matching and Arithmetic Operators

*   **`LIKE` comparison operator**
    *   Used for string pattern matching
    *   `%` replaces an arbitrary number of zero or more characters
    *   underscore (`_`) replaces a single character
    *   Examples: `WHERE Address LIKE '%Houston,TX%';`
    *   `WHERE Ssn LIKE '__1__8901';` *(Slide shows ' _ _ 1 _ _ 8901', corrected for typical SQL LIKE patterns assuming Ssn is 9 digits, 3rd digit is 1, 6th is 8, 7th is 9, 8th is 0, 9th is 1. The original pattern seems to match Ssn LIKE '??1??8901' or ' \_ \_ 1 \_ \_ 8901' meaning two characters, then 1, then two characters, then 8901. The slide ' _ _ 1 _ _ 8901' means Ssn having 1 at 3rd position, and 8901 at 6-9th positions. The original Ssn LIKE ' \_ \_ 1 \_ \_ 8901'; has spaces, it should be `Ssn LIKE '__1__8901';` for 9 characters if SSN is CHAR(9))*
      *Let's assume the example was specific `WHERE Ssn LIKE '_ _ 1 _ _ 8901';` for some specific format, or a typo for `__1__8901`. Given the context, the slide likely meant `WHERE Ssn LIKE '__1__8901';`*
      *The OCR was `WHERE Ssn LIKE ' _ _ 1 _ _ 8901';` which has spaces. SQL wildcards are usually `_` and `%` without spaces around them unless spaces are part of the pattern. If it intended to match fixed length strings with spaces as wildcards, that's not standard SQL. Assuming it's for underscores representing single characters.*
      `WHERE Ssn LIKE '__1__8901';`
*   **`BETWEEN` comparison operator**
    *   E.g., in Q14:
        `WHERE (Salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 40000) AND Dno = 5;`

---

### Arithmetic Operations

*   **Standard arithmetic operators:**
    *   Addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`) may be included as a part of `SELECT`
*   **Query 13.** Show the resulting salaries if every employee working on the 'ProductX' project is given a 10 percent raise.
    ```sql
    SELECT E.Fname, E.Lname, 1.1 * E.Salary AS Increased_sal
    FROM   EMPLOYEE AS E, WORKS_ON AS W, PROJECT AS P
    WHERE  E.Ssn=W.Essn AND W.Pno=P.Pnumber AND
           P.Pname='ProductX';
    ```

---

### Ordering of Query Results

*   Use `ORDER BY` clause
    *   Keyword `DESC` to see result in a descending order of values
    *   Keyword `ASC` to specify ascending order explicitly
    *   Typically placed at the end of the query
    `ORDER BY D.Dname DESC, E.Lname ASC, E.Fname ASC`

---

### Basic SQL Retrieval Query Block

```sql
SELECT     <attribute list>
FROM       <table list>
[ WHERE    <condition> ]
[ ORDER BY <attribute list> ];
```

## INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE Statements in SQL

*   Three commands used to modify the database:
    *   `INSERT`, `DELETE`, and `UPDATE`
*   `INSERT` inserts a tuple (row) in a relation (table)
*   `UPDATE` may update a number of tuples (rows) in a relation (table) that satisfy the condition
*   `DELETE` may also update a number of tuples (rows) in a relation (table) that satisfy the condition *(Note: DELETE removes tuples, it doesn't "update" them. This might be a slight misphrasing on the slide, intending to say it affects a number of tuples.)*
    It should be: `DELETE` may remove a number of tuples (rows) from a relation (table) that satisfy the condition.

---

### INSERT

*   In its simplest form, it is used to add one or more tuples to a relation
*   Attribute values should be listed in the same order as the attributes were specified in the `CREATE TABLE` command
*   Constraints on data types are observed automatically
*   Any integrity constraints as a part of the DDL specification are enforced

---

### The INSERT Command

*   Specify the relation name and a list of values for the tuple. All values including nulls are supplied.
    ```sql
    U1: INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE
        VALUES ('Richard', 'K', 'Marini', '653298653', '1962-12-30', '98 Oak Forest, Katy, TX', 'M', 37000, '653298653', 4);
    ```
*   The variation below inserts multiple tuples where a new table is loaded values from the result of a query.
    ```sql
    U3B: INSERT INTO WORKS_ON_INFO (Emp_name, Proj_name, Hours_per_week)
         SELECT E.Lname, P.Pname, W.Hours
         FROM   PROJECT P, WORKS_ON W, EMPLOYEE E
         WHERE  P.Pnumber=W.Pno AND W.Essn=E.Ssn;
    ```

---

### BULK LOADING OF TABLES

*   Another variation of `INSERT` is used for bulk-loading of several tuples into tables
*   A new table `TNEW` can be created with the same attributes as `T` and using `LIKE` and `DATA` in the syntax, it can be loaded with entire data.
*   **EXAMPLE:**
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE D5EMPS LIKE EMPLOYEE
    (SELECT E.*
     FROM   EMPLOYEE AS E
     WHERE  E.Dno=5)
    WITH DATA;
    ```
    *(Note: The syntax `CREATE TABLE ... LIKE ... (SELECT ...) WITH DATA;` might vary across SQL dialects. A more standard way to create a table and populate it from a query is `CREATE TABLE D5EMPS AS SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Dno=5;` or two steps: `CREATE TABLE D5EMPS LIKE EMPLOYEE;` then `INSERT INTO D5EMPS SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Dno=5;`. The slide presents a specific syntax.)*

---

### DELETE

*   Removes tuples from a relation
    *   Includes a `WHERE`-clause to select the tuples to be deleted
    *   Referential integrity should be enforced
    *   Tuples are deleted from only *one table* at a time (unless `CASCADE` is specified on a referential integrity constraint)
    *   A missing `WHERE`-clause specifies that *all tuples* in the relation are to be deleted; the table then becomes an empty table
    *   The number of tuples deleted depends on the number of tuples in the relation that satisfy the `WHERE`-clause

---

### The DELETE Command

*   Removes tuples from a relation
    *   Includes a `WHERE` clause to select the tuples to be deleted. The number of tuples deleted will vary.

    ```sql
    U4A: DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE
         WHERE Lname='Brown';

    U4B: DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE
         WHERE Ssn='123456789';

    U4C: DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE
         WHERE Dno=5;

    U4D: DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE;
    ```

---

### UPDATE

*   Used to modify attribute values of one or more selected tuples
*   A `WHERE`-clause selects the tuples to be modified
*   An additional `SET`-clause specifies the attributes to be modified and their new values
*   Each command modifies tuples *in the same relation*
*   Referential integrity specified as part of DDL specification is enforced

---

### UPDATE (contd.)

*   **Example:** Change the location and controlling department number of project number 10 to 'Bellaire' and 5, respectively
    ```sql
    U5: UPDATE PROJECT
        SET    PLOCATION = 'Bellaire',
               DNUM = 5
        WHERE  PNUMBER=10;
    ```

---

### UPDATE (contd.)

*   **Example:** Give all employees in the 'Research' department a 10% raise in salary.
    ```sql
    U6: UPDATE EMPLOYEE
        SET    SALARY = SALARY * 1.1
        WHERE  DNO IN (SELECT DNUMBER
                       FROM   DEPARTMENT
                       WHERE  DNAME='Research');
    ```
*   In this request, the modified `SALARY` value depends on the original `SALARY` value in each tuple
    *   The reference to the `SALARY` attribute on the right of `=` refers to the old `SALARY` value before modification
    *   The reference to the `SALARY` attribute on the left of `=` refers to the new `SALARY` value after modification

*   Writing programs in various programming languages that include SQL statements: Embedded and dynamic SQL, SQL/CLI (Call Level Interface) and its predecessor ODBC, SQL/PSM (Persistent Stored Module) (See Ch.10)
*   Set of commands for specifying physical database design parameters, file structures for relations, and access paths, e.g., `CREATE INDEX`

---

### Additional Features of SQL (cont'd.)

*   Transaction control commands (Ch.20)
*   Specifying the granting and revoking of privileges to users (Ch.30)
