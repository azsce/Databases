# Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) Modeling

Our focus for this session is **Chapter 4: Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) Modeling**. As the name suggests, we're going to enhance, or extend, the ER concepts we're already familiar with. This will allow us to represent more complex data requirements and relationships, leading to more robust and accurate database designs. Think of it as adding more powerful tools to your modeling toolkit.

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Chapter Outline

Let's take a look at the roadmap for this chapter.

First, we'll clarify what **EER stands for**: `Enhanced ER` or `Extended ER`. These terms are often used interchangeably.

Next, we'll delve into the core **EER Model Concepts**.
*   It's important to note that EER **includes all modeling concepts of basic ER**. So, everything you've learned so far remains relevant.
*   Then, we'll introduce the **Additional concepts** that make EER so powerful. These include:
    *   The idea of `subclasses` and `superclasses`, which allow us to model hierarchies.
    *   The processes of `specialization` and `generalization`, which are two sides of the same coin for creating these hierarchies.
    *   A concept called `categories`, also known as `UNION types`, for modeling entities that can belong to one of several distinct superclasses.
    *   And, crucially, `attribute and relationship inheritance`, a cornerstone of object-oriented principles that EER incorporates.

We'll then discuss **Constraints on Specialization/Generalization**. Just like in basic ER, constraints are vital for ensuring data integrity and accurately reflecting business rules.

The overarching goal here is that **the additional EER concepts are used to model applications more completely and more accurately**. We're aiming for a richer, more nuanced representation of the real world.
*   And as I mentioned, **EER includes some object-oriented concepts, such as inheritance**, which brings significant advantages in terms of reusability and clarity.

Finally, we'll touch upon **Knowledge Representation and Ontology Concepts**, and see how these broader ideas relate to what we're doing with EER modeling.

This chapter is packed with important extensions, so let's get started.

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Subclasses and Superclasses (1)

Let's begin with the fundamental concepts of `subclasses` and `superclasses`.

Often, an entity type we've defined might have **additional meaningful subgroupings of its entities**. These aren't entirely new entities, but rather more specific versions of the existing one.

Consider an **Example**: The `EMPLOYEE` entity type.
*   We might find it useful to further group `EMPLOYEE`s into:
    *   `SECRETARY`, `ENGINEER`, `TECHNICIAN`, and so on. This grouping would be **based on the EMPLOYEE's Job**. Each of these roles might have specific attributes or relationships that don't apply to all employees.
    *   Another grouping could be `MANAGER`. Here, we're identifying **EMPLOYEEs who are managers, based on the role they play** in the organization. A manager is still an employee, but has additional responsibilities, and perhaps attributes like "ManagedDepartment."
    *   And yet another distinct grouping could be `SALARIED_EMPLOYEE` and `HOURLY_EMPLOYEE`. This is **based on the EMPLOYEE's method of pay**. Again, salaried and hourly employees are both employees, but they might have different attributes related to their compensation.

So, how do we represent these subgroupings? **EER diagrams extend ER diagrams to represent these additional subgroupings**, and we call these more specific groups `subclasses` or `subtypes`. The more general entity type they belong to (like `EMPLOYEE`) is called the `superclass` or `supertype`.

---

## Subclasses and Superclasses (Figure 4.1)

Now, let's look at **Figure 4.1**. This EER diagram notation helps us visualize how subclasses and specializations are represented.

At the top, we see the `EMPLOYEE` entity, which is our superclass. It has common attributes like `Fname`, `Minit`, `Lname` (composing `Name`), `Ssn`, `Birth_date`, and `Address`.

Observe the lines extending downwards from `EMPLOYEE`. Each of these represents a *specialization*.
The first specialization, indicated by the circle with a 'd' (which we'll learn stands for 'disjoint'), groups `EMPLOYEE`s based on their job.
*   The subclasses here are `SECRETARY`, `TECHNICIAN`, and `ENGINEER`.
*   Notice that `SECRETARY` has a specific attribute `Typing_speed`. `TECHNICIAN` has `Tgrade`, and `ENGINEER` has `Eng_type`. These attributes are specific to these subclasses and wouldn't make sense for all employees.

Another specialization from `EMPLOYEE` leads to the subclass `MANAGER`. A manager is an employee with a specific role. The diagram shows a `MANAGES` relationship between `MANAGER` and `PROJECT`.

The third specialization, also marked with a 'd', is based on the method of pay.
*   The subclasses are `HOURLY_EMPLOYEE` and `SALARIED_EMPLOYEE`.
*   `HOURLY_EMPLOYEE` has a `Pay_scale` attribute, and `SALARIED_EMPLOYEE` has a `Salary` attribute.
*   You can also see a `BELONGS_TO` relationship between `HOURLY_EMPLOYEE` and `TRADE_UNION`.

So, this figure clearly illustrates how we can have **three distinct specializations of the `EMPLOYEE` superclass**:
1.  One based on job: `{SECRETARY, TECHNICIAN, ENGINEER}`
2.  One based on role: `{MANAGER}`
3.  One based on pay type: `{HOURLY_EMPLOYEE, SALARIED_EMPLOYEE}`

This structured representation is key to EER modeling.

---

## Subclasses and Superclasses (2)

Let's solidify our understanding of these terms.

*   **Each of these subgroupings** we just saw – `SECRETARY`, `ENGINEER`, `MANAGER`, etc. – **is a subset of `EMPLOYEE` entities**. This means every secretary *is an* employee, every manager *is an* employee, and so on.

*   Therefore, **each is called a `subclass` of `EMPLOYEE`**.

*   Conversely, **`EMPLOYEE` is the `superclass` for each of these subclasses**.

*   These relationships are formally called **`superclass/subclass relationships`**.
    *   So, we have `EMPLOYEE/SECRETARY`, `EMPLOYEE/TECHNICIAN`, `EMPLOYEE/MANAGER`, and so forth.

This hierarchical relationship is fundamental.

---

## Subclasses and Superclasses (3)

These `superclass/subclass relationships` are also commonly referred to as **`IS-A` relationships**. This is a very intuitive way to think about them.
    *   For instance, a `SECRETARY IS-A EMPLOYEE`. A `TECHNICIAN IS-A EMPLOYEE`. This phrasing helps confirm if the relationship is modeled correctly.

Now, a crucial **Note**: An entity that is a member of a subclass represents the **same real-world entity** as some member of the superclass.
    *   This means the subclass member is the same entity, but viewed in a **distinct, specific role** or with specific characteristics. A person who is a secretary is that same person when considered simply as an employee.
    *   A very important rule: **An entity cannot exist in the database merely by being a member of a subclass; it must also be a member of the superclass**. You can't have a secretary who isn't also an employee. The superclass provides the foundational identity.
    *   Furthermore, **a member of the superclass can be optionally included as a member of any number of its subclasses**, depending on the constraints, which we'll discuss later. An employee *might* be a secretary, or an engineer, or a manager, or perhaps none of these specific roles if they have a different job title not captured by a subclass.

---

## Subclasses and Superclasses (4)

Let's look at a few more **Examples** to illustrate how an entity can belong to multiple subclasses across different specializations:

*   Consider **a salaried employee who is also an engineer**. This individual would belong to **two subclasses** simultaneously:
    *   `ENGINEER` (from the job-based specialization)
    *   `SALARIED_EMPLOYEE` (from the pay-type-based specialization)

*   Now, imagine **a salaried employee who is also an engineering manager**. This person would belong to **three subclasses**:
    *   `MANAGER` (from the role-based specialization)
    *   `ENGINEER` (from the job-based specialization)
    *   `SALARIED_EMPLOYEE` (from the pay-type-based specialization)

It's important to remember that **it is not necessary that every entity in a superclass be a member of some subclass**. For example, an `EMPLOYEE` might be a "Clerk." If "Clerk" is not defined as a subclass in any of our specializations, then that employee exists only as an instance of the `EMPLOYEE` superclass, without belonging to any of the defined subclasses like `SECRETARY` or `MANAGER`. This concept is related to the *completeness constraint*, which we'll cover shortly.

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Attribute Inheritance in Superclass / Subclass Relationships

One of the most powerful features of `superclass/subclass relationships` is **`attribute inheritance`**.

What does this mean?
*   An entity that is a member of a subclass **inherits**:
    *   **All attributes** of the entity as a member of the superclass.
    *   **All relationships** of the entity as a member of the superclass.

Let's take an **Example** from our `EMPLOYEE` diagram:
*   In the diagram we saw (Figure 4.1), a `SECRETARY` (as well as a `TECHNICIAN` and an `ENGINEER`) **inherits the attributes** `Name`, `Ssn`, `Birth_date`, `Address`, and any other attributes defined directly for the `EMPLOYEE` superclass.
*   This means that **every `SECRETARY` entity will have values for these inherited attributes**, in addition to any attributes specific to the `SECRETARY` subclass itself (like `Typing_speed`).

Inheritance avoids redundancy and promotes a clear, hierarchical structure. The common characteristics are defined once at the superclass level and automatically apply to all its subclasses.

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Specialization

Now, let's formally define the process of **`Specialization`**.

### Representing Specialization in EER Diagrams

Let's look at **Figure 4.4**, which provides a focused view of an EER diagram notation specifically for an **attribute-defined specialization**.

Here, we have the `EMPLOYEE` superclass with its attributes, including `Job_type`.
The diagram shows a line emanating from `EMPLOYEE` downwards, leading to a circle with a 'd' (for disjoint). Written next to this line, above the circle, is `Job_type`. This indicates that the `Job_type` attribute is the *defining attribute* for this particular specialization.

The values of `Job_type` determine which subclass an employee belongs to.
*   If `Job_type` is 'Secretary', the employee is an instance of the `SECRETARY` subclass, which has its own specific attribute, `Typing_speed`.
*   If `Job_type` is 'Technician', the employee is an instance of the `TECHNICIAN` subclass, with its attribute `Tgrade`.
*   And if `Job_type` is 'Engineer', the employee is an instance of the `ENGINEER` subclass, with its attribute `Eng_type`.

This figure clearly illustrates how an attribute of the superclass can be used to systematically categorize entities into distinct subclasses.

---

### Specialization (1)

So, what is `specialization`?
*   **`Specialization` is the process of defining a set of subclasses of a superclass.** It's a top-down approach. We start with a general entity type and identify more specific subgroupings within it.

*   **The set of subclasses is based upon some distinguishing characteristics of the entities in the superclass.** These characteristics might be an attribute value, a role, or some other defining property.

Let's revisit our examples:
*   The set `{SECRETARY, ENGINEER, TECHNICIAN}` **is a specialization of `EMPLOYEE` based upon the `job type` attribute.**
*   `MANAGER` **is a specialization of `EMPLOYEE` based on the role the employee plays.**

It's also important to note that we **may have several specializations of the same superclass**, as we saw in Figure 4.1 where `EMPLOYEE` was specialized based on job, based on role, and based on pay type, all independently.

---

### Specialization (3)

To reinforce this, let's look at **Figure 4.1** again. This EER diagram effectively showcases multiple specializations originating from the single superclass `EMPLOYEE`.

As we discussed earlier when analyzing Figure 4.1:
The `EMPLOYEE` entity is the superclass.
From `EMPLOYEE`, we see three distinct specialization constructs leading to different sets of subclasses.

The first specialization is based on the implicit job type, creating the subclasses `SECRETARY`, `TECHNICIAN`, and `ENGINEER`. Each of these has its own specific attributes like `Typing_speed`, `Tgrade`, and `Eng_type`, respectively.

The second specialization defines the subclass `MANAGER`, which then participates in a `MANAGES` relationship with `PROJECT`.

The third specialization, based on pay structure, defines `HOURLY_EMPLOYEE` (with `Pay_scale`) and `SALARIED_EMPLOYEE` (with `Salary`). `HOURLY_EMPLOYEE` also has a `BELONGS_TO` relationship with `TRADE_UNION`.

This diagram perfectly encapsulates the idea that a single superclass can be the starting point for **multiple, independent specializations**, each highlighting different aspects or subgroupings within that superclass. The three specializations shown are:
1.  `{SECRETARY, TECHNICIAN, ENGINEER}`
2.  `{MANAGER}`
3.  `{HOURLY_EMPLOYEE, SALARIED_EMPLOYEE}`

This ability to model multiple facets of an entity type is a key strength of EER.

*Self-correction: Slide 9 and 13 are indeed identical in the source, titled "Specialization (3)" and showing Figure 4.1. I've provided the explanation for this slide as requested.*

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Generalization

Now let's consider **`Generalization`**.

*   **`Generalization` is essentially the reverse of the specialization process.** Instead of starting with a general entity and breaking it down, we start with several distinct entity types that share common features and abstract those common features into a new, more general superclass. It's a bottom-up approach.

*   So, **several classes with common features are generalized into a superclass; the original classes then become its subclasses.**

Consider an **Example**:
*   Suppose we initially modeled `CAR` and `TRUCK` as separate entity types. We might observe they share common attributes like `VehicleID`, `LicensePlateNo`, `Price`.
*   We can then generalize `CAR` and `TRUCK` into a new superclass called `VEHICLE`.
    *   Both `CAR` and `TRUCK` become subclasses of the superclass `VEHICLE`. `VEHICLE` would hold the common attributes, while `CAR` might retain specific attributes like `NoOfPassengers` and `TRUCK` might have `Tonnage`.
    *   So, we can view `{CAR, TRUCK}` as a specialization of `VEHICLE` (looking top-down).
    *   Alternatively, and this is the essence of generalization, we can view `VEHICLE` as a generalization of `CAR` and `TRUCK` (looking bottom-up).

It's really two perspectives on the same underlying superclass/subclass structure.

---

## Generalization (2)

Let's look at **Figure 4.3** to visualize this generalization process.

**Diagram (a)** shows the "before" state.
*   We have two distinct entity types: `CAR` and `TRUCK`.
*   `CAR` has attributes like `Max_speed`, `Vehicle_id`, `No_of_passengers`, `License_plate_no`, and `Price`.
*   `TRUCK` has attributes like `Tonnage`, `Vehicle_id`, `No_of_axles`, `License_plate_no`, and `Price`.
*   Notice the common attributes: `Vehicle_id`, `License_plate_no`, and `Price`.

**Diagram (b)** shows the "after" state, once generalization has been applied.
*   We've created a new superclass `VEHICLE`.
*   `VEHICLE` now holds the common attributes: `Vehicle_id`, `Price`, and `License_plate_no`.
*   `CAR` and `TRUCK` are now subclasses of `VEHICLE`.
*   `CAR` retains its specific attributes `Max_speed` and `No_of_passengers`.
*   `TRUCK` retains its specific attributes `No_of_axles` and `Tonnage`.
*   The 'd' in the circle indicates that this generalization results in disjoint subclasses (a vehicle is either a car or a truck in this simplified model, but not both).

**Figure 4.3** clearly illustrates:
(a) The initial state with two separate entity types, `CAR` and `TRUCK`.
(b) The result of generalizing `CAR` and `TRUCK` into the superclass `VEHICLE`, which captures their shared characteristics.

This process helps in reducing redundancy and identifying commonalities, leading to a more organized and efficient model.

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Generalization and Specialization (2)

Let's further discuss **Data Modeling with Specialization and Generalization**. Whether we arrive at a superclass/subclass structure through top-down specialization or bottom-up generalization, the resulting model has certain characteristics.

*   A **superclass or subclass represents a collection** (or set or grouping) **of entities**. For instance, `EMPLOYEE` represents all employee entities, while `SECRETARY` represents only those employee entities that are secretaries.

*   It also represents a **particular `type of entity`**. `EMPLOYEE` is an entity type, and `SECRETARY` is also an entity type, albeit a more specific one.

*   In EER diagrams, both superclasses and subclasses are **shown in rectangles**, just like regular entity types in basic ER modeling.

*   A useful term to adopt: We can call all entity types (and their corresponding collections of entities) **`classes`**, whether they are basic entity types, superclasses, or subclasses. This provides a consistent vocabulary. So, `PERSON`, `EMPLOYEE`, and `SECRETARY` are all considered classes in this context.

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Types of Specialization

When we create a specialization, how do we define which entities of the superclass belong to which subclass? There are a few ways:

*   **`Predicate-defined` (or `condition-defined`) specialization**: Here, membership in a subclass is based on some explicit predicate or condition.
    *   For example, we could define a subclass `SENIOR_EMPLOYEE` based on the value of an `Age` attribute (e.g., `Age > 55`) or `Job-type` (e.g., `Job-type = 'Manager'`).

*   **`Attribute-defined` specialization**: This is a common type of predicate-defined specialization where the condition is based on the value of a single attribute of the superclass.
    *   We **show the name of this defining attribute next to the line drawn from the superclass toward the subclasses** (as seen in Figure 4.1 for `Job_type` in the EER notation, or explicitly labeled in some other notations). This was illustrated in Figure 4.4 with the `Job_type` attribute determining membership in `SECRETARY`, `TECHNICIAN`, or `ENGINEER`.

*   **`User-defined` specialization**: In this case, there's no explicit condition or predicate. Membership in a subclass is **defined by the user on an entity-by-entity basis**. The database user or application explicitly assigns an entity to one or more subclasses. This provides flexibility when the criteria for subclass membership are not easily expressible as a simple condition on attributes.

Understanding these types helps us correctly model and implement specialization rules.

---

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Constraints on Specialization and Generalization

Just as with basic ER modeling, constraints play a vital role in EER modeling to ensure the integrity and accuracy of our database schema. Let's delve into the constraints that apply specifically to `specialization` and `generalization` structures.

### Constraints on Specialization and Generalization (2)

Let's re-emphasize the types of specialization based on how membership is determined, as this ties into how constraints are applied.

*   If all subclasses in a particular specialization have their membership condition based on the **same attribute of the superclass**, then that specialization is called an **`attribute-defined specialization`**.
    *   The attribute used for this condition is called the **`defining attribute` of the specialization**.
    *   For **Example**: If `JobType` is an attribute of `EMPLOYEE`, and its value determines whether an employee is a `SECRETARY`, `TECHNICIAN`, or `ENGINEER`, then `JobType` is the defining attribute of that specialization.

*   Alternatively, if **no explicit condition determines membership**, and the assignment to a subclass is done manually by a user or application, the subclass (or specialization) is called **`user-defined`**.
    *   In this scenario, **membership in a subclass is determined by the database users** typically by applying an operation to explicitly add an entity to the subclass.
    *   Essentially, **membership in the subclass is specified individually for each entity in the superclass by the user**.

---

### Displaying an attribute-defined specialization in EER diagrams

Let's revisit **Figure 4.4** to clearly see how an attribute-defined specialization is depicted in EER diagrams.

As we've discussed, the `EMPLOYEE` superclass has an attribute `Job_type`. The specialization emanating from `EMPLOYEE` is explicitly linked to this `Job_type` attribute in the diagram (often shown by writing the attribute name near the specialization circle).
*   The diagram shows that the value of `Job_type` (e.g., 'Secretary', 'Engineer', 'Technician') dictates which of the subclasses (`SECRETARY`, `ENGINEER`, `TECHNICIAN`) an `EMPLOYEE` entity belongs to.
*   The `SECRETARY` subclass has its specific attribute `Typing_speed`, `TECHNICIAN` has `Tgrade`, and `ENGINEER` has `Eng_type`.
*   The 'd' in the circle signifies a disjoint constraint, which we are about to discuss.

This visual representation makes it immediately clear that the specialization is determined by the values of the `Job_type` attribute.

---
### Constraints on Specialization and Generalization (3)

Now, let's introduce two fundamental constraints that can apply to any `specialization` or `generalization`:

1.  The **`Disjointness Constraint`**: This constraint addresses whether an entity from the superclass can be a member of more than one subclass *within the same specialization*.
2.  The **`Completeness Constraint`**: This constraint addresses whether every entity in the superclass *must* be a member of at least one subclass *within that specialization*.

These two constraints are independent and can be combined in various ways.

---

### Constraints on Specialization and Generalization (4)

Let's first focus on the **`Disjointness Constraint`**.

*   This constraint **specifies that the subclasses of a particular specialization must be `disjoint`**.
    *   What does `disjoint` mean? It means that **an entity can be a member of at most one of the subclasses of that specialization**. For example, if the specialization of `EMPLOYEE` into `SECRETARY`, `ENGINEER`, and `TECHNICIAN` is disjoint, then an employee can be a secretary, or an engineer, or a technician, but not, for instance, both a secretary and an engineer simultaneously *within that specific job-role specialization*.
    *   In EER diagrams, a disjoint specialization is **specified by a 'd' inside the circle** that connects the superclass to its subclasses.

*   What if the subclasses are not disjoint? Then, the specialization is **`overlapping`**.
    *   This means that **the same entity may be a member of more than one subclass of that particular specialization**. For example, if we had a specialization of `PERSON` into `STUDENT` and `EMPLOYEE`, and this specialization was overlapping, then a person could be both a student and an employee at the same time.
    *   An overlapping specialization is **specified by an 'o' inside the circle** in the EER diagram.

---

### Constraints on Specialization and Generalization (5)

Next, let's examine the **`Completeness (Exhaustiveness) Constraint`**.

*   The **`Total` completeness constraint** specifies that **every entity in the superclass must be a member of some subclass in that specific specialization/generalization**. There are no "leftover" superclass entities that don't fit into any of the defined subclasses for that specialization.
    *   In EER diagrams, a total specialization is **shown by a `double line`** connecting the superclass to the specialization circle.

*   The **`Partial` completeness constraint** allows an entity in the superclass **not to belong to any of the subclasses** within that specialization. This means an entity can be an instance of the superclass only, without being further categorized into one of its subclasses for that particular specialization.
    *   In EER diagrams, a partial specialization is **shown by a `single line`** connecting the superclass to the specialization circle.

---

### Constraints on Specialization and Generalization (6)

Given these two independent constraints (Disjointness: disjoint 'd' or overlapping 'o'; Completeness: total 'double line' or partial 'single line'), we can have **four types of specialization/generalization**:

1.  **`Disjoint, total`**: An entity must belong to exactly one subclass.
2.  **`Disjoint, partial`**: An entity may belong to at most one subclass (or none).
3.  **`Overlapping, total`**: An entity must belong to at least one subclass, and can belong to more than one.
4.  **`Overlapping, partial`**: An entity may belong to one or more subclasses (or none).

A **Note** on generalization: When we perform generalization (bottom-up), the resulting specialization is **usually `total`**. This is because the superclass is typically derived directly from the union of the subclasses; we are saying that the superclass *is composed of* these subclasses. However, it's not an absolute rule, but a common outcome of the generalization process.

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Example of disjoint partial Specialization

Let's look at **Figure 4.4** again, this time focusing on the constraints.

We see the `EMPLOYEE` superclass being specialized based on the `Job_type` attribute into `SECRETARY`, `TECHNICIAN`, and `ENGINEER`.

Notice the circle connecting `EMPLOYEE` to these subclasses contains a **'d'**. This signifies a **`disjoint`** constraint. An employee is either a secretary, OR a technician, OR an engineer, but not a combination of these *within this job specialization*.

Now, observe the line connecting `EMPLOYEE` to the specialization circle. It's a **`single line`**. This indicates a **`partial`** completeness constraint. This means an `EMPLOYEE` entity does *not* have to be a `SECRETARY`, `TECHNICIAN`, or `ENGINEER`. They could be, for example, a "Salesperson" or some other role not covered by these specific subclasses.

So, Figure 4.4 illustrates a **disjoint, partial specialization**.

---

## Example of overlapping total Specialization

Now, let's consider an example of an **overlapping, total specialization**, as shown in **Figure 4.5**.

Here, we have a `PART` entity. This `PART` entity is specialized into `MANUFACTURED_PART` and `PURCHASED_PART`.
*   `MANUFACTURED_PART` has attributes like `Manufacture_date`, `Batch_no`, and `Drawing_no`.
*   `PURCHASED_PART` has attributes like `Supplier_name` and `List_price`.

Focus on the specialization circle. It contains an **'o'**. This indicates an **`overlapping`** constraint. A part *can be* both a manufactured part (perhaps manufactured in-house from raw materials) *and* a purchased part (perhaps also bought from an external supplier as an alternative source, or if it's a component that's sometimes made and sometimes bought).

Now, look at the line connecting `PART` to the specialization circle. It's a **`double line`**. This signifies a **`total`** completeness constraint. This means every `PART` entity *must be* either a `MANUFACTURED_PART`, or a `PURCHASED_PART`, or potentially both (because it's overlapping). There are no `PART` entities that are neither manufactured nor purchased in this model.

Thus, Figure 4.5 effectively depicts an **overlapping, total specialization**.

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Specialization/Generalization Hierarchies, Lattices & Shared Subclasses (1)

The concept of subclasses and superclasses can be extended to multiple levels.

*   A **subclass may itself have further subclasses specified on it**. This means a subclass can also act as a superclass for even more specific subclasses.
    *   When this happens, it **forms a `hierarchy` or a `lattice`**.

*   A **`Hierarchy`** has a specific constraint: **every subclass has only one superclass**. This is often called **`single inheritance`**. The resulting structure is basically a **`tree structure`**, where each subclass has only one "parent" superclass.

*   In a **`Lattice`**, however, a **subclass can be a subclass of more than one superclass**. This is known as **`multiple inheritance`**. This allows a subclass to inherit attributes and relationships from multiple parent superclasses, creating a more complex, graph-like structure rather than a simple tree.

---

## Shared Subclass "Engineering_Manager"

Let's look at **Figure 4.6** to understand a specialization lattice involving a **`shared subclass`**. A shared subclass is one that has multiple superclasses, thus demonstrating multiple inheritance.

At the top, we have the `EMPLOYEE` superclass.
`EMPLOYEE` has two distinct specializations:
1.  One (disjoint, partial) into `SECRETARY`, `TECHNICIAN`, `ENGINEER`, and `MANAGER`.
2.  Another (disjoint, partial) into `HOURLY_EMPLOYEE` and `SALARIED_EMPLOYEE`.

Now, focus on the subclass `ENGINEERING_MANAGER` at the bottom.
`ENGINEERING_MANAGER` is shown as a subclass of *both* `ENGINEER` (from the first specialization) *and* `MANAGER` (also from the first specialization).
It might also be implicitly, or explicitly if drawn, a subclass of `SALARIED_EMPLOYEE` if all engineering managers are salaried.

The key here is that `ENGINEERING_MANAGER` inherits characteristics from both `ENGINEER` (e.g., technical skills, `Eng_type`) and `MANAGER` (e.g., managerial duties, perhaps a `ManagesProject` relationship). This makes `ENGINEERING_MANAGER` a shared subclass.

The overall structure formed by `EMPLOYEE`, its initial subclasses, and then `ENGINEERING_MANAGER` forms a **lattice**, not a simple hierarchy, because `ENGINEERING_MANAGER` has more than one direct superclass within the same conceptual grouping of roles.
**Figure 4.6** is titled: "A specialization lattice with shared subclass ENGINEERING_MANAGER."

---

## Specialization/Generalization Hierarchies, Lattices & Shared Subclasses (2)

Let's elaborate on inheritance in these complex structures.

*   **In a lattice or hierarchy, a subclass inherits attributes not only of its direct superclass, but also of all its predecessor superclasses** up the chain. So, if `C` is a subclass of `B`, and `B` is a subclass of `A`, then `C` inherits from both `B` and `A`.

*   As we saw, **a subclass with more than one superclass is called a `shared subclass`** (this is the mechanism for `multiple inheritance`).

*   We can have:
    *   **`specialization` hierarchies or lattices**, which are typically created top-down.
    *   **`generalization` hierarchies or lattices**, typically created bottom-up.
    *   The distinction depends on how they were conceptually **`derived`**.

*   However, regardless of the derivation process (top-down specialization or bottom-up generalization), the end result is a structure of superclasses and subclasses. For simplicity, **we often just use the term `specialization` to stand for the end result of either process**.

---

## Specialization/Generalization Hierarchies, Lattices & Shared Subclasses (3)

Let's clarify the conceptual processes:

*   In **`specialization`**, we **start with an entity type and then define subclasses of that entity type by successive specialization**. We refine the general concept into more specific ones.
    *   This is often called a **`top-down` conceptual refinement process**.

*   In **`generalization`**, we **start with many entity types and generalize those that have common properties** into a common superclass. We synthesize specific concepts into a more general one.
    *   This is called a **`bottom-up` conceptual synthesis process**.

*   **In practice, a `combination of both processes` is usually employed** during database design. A designer might move back and forth, sometimes specializing and sometimes generalizing, as their understanding of the domain evolves.

---

## Specialization / Generalization Lattice Example (UNIVERSITY)

**Figure 4.7** provides a comprehensive example of a **specialization/generalization lattice** within a `UNIVERSITY` database context. This diagram illustrates multiple inheritance effectively.

Let's break it down:
At the very top, we have the `PERSON` superclass, with general attributes like `Name`, `Ssn`, `Sex`, `Address`, `Birth_date`.
`PERSON` is specialized (this one is an overlapping, total specialization, indicated by 'o' and a double line) into:
*   `EMPLOYEE` (with `Salary`, `hire_emp` date)
*   `ALUMNUS` (with `new_alumnus` details, `Degrees`)
*   `STUDENT` (with `Major_dept`, `change_major` info)

Now, follow the branches:
`EMPLOYEE` is further specialized (disjoint, partial - 'd' and single line) into:
*   `STAFF` (with `Position`)
*   `FACULTY` (with `Rank`, potentially `Project` involvement)

`STUDENT` is specialized (disjoint, partial - 'd' and single line) into:
*   `GRADUATE_STUDENT` (with `Degree_program`)
*   `UNDERGRADUATE_STUDENT` (with `Class` level)

Now, here's the lattice part – the **shared subclass**:
`STUDENT_ASSISTANT` (with `Percent_time`) is shown as a subclass of *both* `FACULTY` *and* `GRADUATE_STUDENT`. This is multiple inheritance. A student assistant is both a member of the faculty (in some capacity) and a graduate student.
`STUDENT_ASSISTANT` is then further specialized (disjoint, partial - 'd' and single line) into:
*   `RESEARCH_ASSISTANT` (related to `Project`)
*   `TEACHING_ASSISTANT` (related to `Course`)

**Figure 4.7** is aptly titled: "A specialization lattice with multiple inheritance for a UNIVERSITY database." It demonstrates how entities can inherit properties from multiple lines of ancestry, creating a rich and complex model.

## Categories (UNION TYPES) (1)

So far, all the `superclass/subclass relationships` we've seen, even with shared subclasses, involve a subclass inheriting from one or more superclasses where each such superclass/subclass link is distinct. That is, a shared subclass like `ENGINEERING_MANAGER` has a relationship with `ENGINEER` AND a separate relationship with `MANAGER`.

Now, we introduce a different concept called **`Categories`** or **`UNION TYPES`**.

*   **All of the superclass/subclass relationships we have seen thus far have a single superclass** for each individual specialization link.
*   A **`shared subclass`** (like `ENGINEERING_MANAGER`) is a subclass involved in:
    *   **more than one distinct superclass/subclass relationships** (e.g., `ENGINEER` is-superclass-of `ENGINEERING_MANAGER`, AND `MANAGER` is-superclass-of `ENGINEERING_MANAGER`).
    *   Each of these individual relationships still has a **single superclass**.
    *   The shared subclass then leads to multiple inheritance.

*   However, **in some cases, we need to model a single superclass/subclass relationship where the entity in the subclass can originate from *one of several possible*, and potentially *different*, superclasses.**
*   These potential **superclasses can represent different entity types**.
*   Such a subclass, whose members are a *union* of entities from different entity types, is called a **`category`** or **`UNION TYPE`**. The key symbol here is often a 'U' in a circle.

## Categories (UNION TYPES) (2)

Let's clarify with an **Example**:
*   Consider a database for vehicle registration. A vehicle **`OWNER`** can be a `PERSON`, or a `BANK` (e.g., holding a lien on a vehicle), or a `COMPANY`. `PERSON`, `BANK`, and `COMPANY` are distinct entity types.

*   A **`category` (UNION type) called `OWNER` is created to represent a subset of the *union* of the entities from these three superclasses**: `COMPANY`, `BANK`, and `PERSON`.
    *   So, an instance of `OWNER` is *either* a `PERSON`, *or* a `BANK`, *or* a `COMPANY`.

*   A crucial rule for categories: **A category member must exist in *at least one* (and typically *just one*) of its superclasses.** An owner entity must correspond to an existing person, bank, or company entity.

How is this **different from a `shared subclass`**?
*   A `shared subclass` is a subset of the *intersection* of its superclasses. A member of a shared subclass *must be an instance of all* its superclasses (e.g., an `ENGINEERING_MANAGER` is an `ENGINEER` *and* a `MANAGER`).
*   In contrast, a `category` member is an instance of the *union* of its potential superclasses. It must exist in *one* of them.

## Two categories (UNION types): OWNER, REGISTERED_VEHICLE

**Figure 4.8** illustrates two categories or UNION types.

Let's examine the top part first, defining the `OWNER` category:
*   We have three distinct entity types: `PERSON` (with attributes `Ssn`, `Name`, `Address`, `Driver_license_no`), `BANK` (with `Bname`, `Baddress`), and `COMPANY` (with `Cname`, `Caddress`).
*   These three entity types act as superclasses for the category `OWNER`. The circle with a **'U'** signifies this UNION type.
*   An instance of `OWNER` is an entity that is *either* a `PERSON`, *or* a `BANK`, *or* a `COMPANY`.
*   The `OWNER` category then participates in an `OWNS` relationship (M:N) with `REGISTERED_VEHICLE`. The `OWNS` relationship has attributes like `Lien_or_regular` and `Purchase_date`.

Now, let's look at the bottom part, defining the `REGISTERED_VEHICLE` category:
*   We have two distinct entity types: `CAR` (with `Cstyle`, `Cmake`, `Cyear`, `Cmodel`) and `TRUCK` (with `Tonnage`, `Tmake`, `Tyear`, `Tmodel`). Both also have `Vehicle_id`.
*   These two entity types act as superclasses for the category `REGISTERED_VEHICLE`, again indicated by the **'U'** in the circle.
*   An instance of `REGISTERED_VEHICLE` is an entity that is *either* a `CAR` *or* a `TRUCK`.

**Figure 4.8** is titled: "Two categories (union types): OWNER and REGISTERED_VEHICLE." This diagram clearly shows how categories allow us to group entities from different source types into a single conceptual unit for relationships or further modeling.
