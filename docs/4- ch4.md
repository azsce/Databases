## Subclasses and Superclasses
*   An entity type may have additional meaningful subgroupings of its entities
    *   Example: EMPLOYEE may be further grouped into:
        *   SECRETARY, ENGINEER, TECHNICIAN, ...
            *   Based on the EMPLOYEE's Job
        *   MANAGER
            *   EMPLOYEES who are managers (the role they play)
        *   SALARIED_EMPLOYEE, HOURLY_EMPLOYEE
            *   Based on the EMPLOYEE's method of pay
*   EER diagrams extend ER diagrams to represent these additional subgroupings, called **subclasses** or **subtypes**

**Figure 4.1** EER diagram notation to represent subclasses and specialization.

<div style={{ 
    margin: '0 2rem 1rem 0',
    background: 'transparent',
    display: 'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
}}>
    <IdealImage
        img={require('@site/static/img/4/4.1.png')}
        style={{
            objectFit: 'cover',
            borderRadius: '8px',
        }}
    />
</div>



*   Each of these subgroupings is a subset of EMPLOYEE entities
*   Each is called a subclass of EMPLOYEE
*   EMPLOYEE is the superclass for each of these subclasses
*   These are called superclass/subclass relationships:
    *   EMPLOYEE/SECRETARY
    *   EMPLOYEE/TECHNICIAN
    *   EMPLOYEE/MANAGER
    *   ...
*   These are also called IS-A relationships
    *   SECRETARY IS-A EMPLOYEE, TECHNICIAN IS-A EMPLOYEE, ....
*   Note: An entity that is member of a subclass represents the same real-world entity as some member of the superclass:
    *   The subclass member is the same entity in a *distinct specific role*
    *   An entity cannot exist in the database merely by being a member of a subclass; it must also be a member of the superclass
    *   A member of the superclass can be optionally included as a member of any number of its subclasses
*   Examples:
    *   A salaried employee who is also an engineer belongs to the two subclasses:
        *   ENGINEER, and
        *   SALARIED_EMPLOYEE
    *   A salaried employee who is also an engineering manager belongs to the three subclasses:
        *   MANAGER,
        *   ENGINEER, and
        *   SALARIED_EMPLOYEE
*   **It is not necessary that every entity in a superclass be a member of some subclass**

## Attribute Inheritance in Superclass / Subclass Relationships
*   An entity that is member of a subclass *inherits*
    *   All attributes of the entity as a member of the superclass
    *   All relationships of the entity as a member of the superclass
*   Example:
    *   In the previous slide, SECRETARY (as well as TECHNICIAN and ENGINEER) inherit the attributes Name, SSN, ..., from EMPLOYEE
    *   Every SECRETARY entity will have values for the inherited attributes

---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Specialization

*   `Specialization` is the process of defining a set of subclasses of a superclass
*   The set of subclasses is based upon some distinguishing characteristics of the entities in the superclass
    *   Example: SECRETARY, ENGINEER, TECHNICIAN is a specialization of EMPLOYEE based upon *job type*.
    *   Example: MANAGER is a specialization of EMPLOYEE *based on the role the employee plays*
    *   May have several specializations of the same superclass

        }}
    />

## Generalization
*   `Generalization` is the reverse of the specialization process
*   Several classes with common features are generalized into a superclass;
    *   original classes become its subclasses
*   Example: CAR, TRUCK generalized into VEHICLE;
    *   both CAR, TRUCK become subclasses of the superclass VEHICLE.
    *   We can view CAR, TRUCK as a specialization of VEHICLE
    *   Alternatively, we can view VEHICLE as a generalization of CAR and TRUCK

## Generalization and Specialization
*   Data Modeling with Specialization and Generalization
    *   A *superclass* or *subclass* represents a collection (or set or grouping) of entities
    *   It also represents a particular *type of entity*
    *   Shown in rectangles in EER diagrams (as are entity types)
    *   We can call all entity types (and their corresponding collections) **classes**, whether they are entity types, superclasses, or subclasses

---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Types of Specialization
*   Predicate-defined ( or condition-defined) : based on some predicate. E.g., based on value of an attribute, say, Job-type, or Age.
*   Attribute-defined: shows the name of the attribute next to the line drawn from the superclass toward the subclasses (see Fig. 4.1)
*   User-defined: membership is defined by the user on an entity by entity basis

---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Constraints on Specialization and Generalization
*   If all subclasses in a specialization have membership condition on same attribute of the superclass, specialization is called an attribute-defined specialization
    *   Attribute is called the defining attribute of the specialization
    *   Example: JobType is the defining attribute of the specialization SECRETARY, TECHNICIAN, ENGINEER of EMPLOYEE
*   If no condition determines membership, the subclass is called user-defined
    *   Membership in a subclass is determined by the database users by applying an operation to add an entity to the subclass
    *   Membership in the subclass is specified individually for each entity in the superclass by the user

### Displaying an attribute-defined specialization in EER diagrams

**Figure 4.4** EER diagram notation for an attribute-defined specialization on Job_type.

<div style={{ 
    margin: '0 2rem 1rem 0',
    background: 'transparent',
    display: 'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
}}>
    <IdealImage
        img={require('@site/static/img/4/4.4.png')}
        style={{
            objectFit: 'cover',
            borderRadius: '8px',
        }}
    />
</div>

*   Two basic constraints can apply to a specialization/generalization:
    *   **Disjointness Constraint**
    *   **Completeness Constraint**
---
*   `Disjointness Constraint:`
    *   Specifies that the subclasses of the specialization must be *disjoint*:
        *   an entity can be a member of at most one of the subclasses of the specialization
    *   Specified by **d** in EER diagram
    *   If not disjoint, specialization is *overlapping*:
        *   that is the same entity may be a member of more than one subclass of the specialization
    *   Specified by **o** in EER diagram
---
*   `Completeness (Exhaustiveness) Constraint:`
    *   *Total* specifies that every entity in the superclass must be a member of some subclass in the specialization/generalization
    *   Shown in EER diagrams by a **double line**
    *   *Partial* allows an entity not to belong to any of the subclasses
    *   Shown in EER diagrams by a single line
---
*   Hence, we have *four types* of specialization/generalization:
    *   **Disjoint, total**
    *   **Disjoint, partial**
    *   **Overlapping, total**
    *   **Overlapping, partial**
*   Note: Generalization usually is total because the superclass is derived from the subclasses.

        style={{
            objectFit: 'cover',
            borderRadius: '8px',
        }}
    />
</div>

## Example of overlapping total Specialization

        style={{

            borderRadius: '8px',
        }}
    />

## Specialization/Generalization Hierarchies, Lattices & Shared Subclasses
*   A subclass may itself have further subclasses specified on it
    *   forms a hierarchy or a lattice
*   **`Hierarchy`** has a constraint that every subclass has only one superclass (called **single inheritance**); this is basically a **tree structure**
*   In a **`lattice`**, a subclass can be subclass of more than one superclass (called **multiple inheritance**)

### Shared Subclass "Engineering_Manager"

**Figure 4.6** A specialization lattice with shared subclass ENGINEERING_MANAGER.

<div style={{ 
    margin: '0 2rem 1rem 0',
    background: 'transparent',
    display: 'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
}}>
    <IdealImage
        img={require('@site/static/img/4/4.6.png')}
        style={{
            objectFit: 'cover',
            borderRadius: '8px',
        }}
    />
</div>

*   In a lattice or hierarchy, a subclass inherits attributes not only of its direct superclass, but also of all its predecessor superclasses
*   A subclass with more than one superclass is called a shared subclass (multiple inheritance)
*   Can have:
    *   *specialization* hierarchies or lattices, or
    *   *generalization* hierarchies or lattices,
    *   depending on how they were *derived*
*   We just use *specialization* (to stand for the end result of either specialization or generalization)


*   In *`specialization`*, start with an entity type and then define subclasses of the entity type by successive specialization
    *   called a *top down* conceptual refinement process
*   In *`generalization`*, start with many entity types and generalize those that have common properties
    *   Called a *bottom up* conceptual synthesis process
*   In practice, a *combination of both processes* is usually employed

## Categories (UNION TYPES)
*   All of the superclass/subclass relationships we have seen thus far have a single superclass
*   A `shared subclass` is a subclass in:
    *   *more than one* distinct superclass/subclass relationships
    *   each relationships has a *single* superclass
    *   shared subclass leads to multiple inheritance
*   In some cases, we need to model a single superclass/subclass relationship with *more than one superclass*
*   Superclasses can represent different entity types
*   Such a subclass is called a **category** or **UNION TYPE**
*   Example: In a database for vehicle registration, a vehicle owner can be a PERSON, a BANK (holding a lien on a vehicle) or a COMPANY.
    *   A *category* (UNION type) called OWNER is created to represent a subset of the *union* of the three superclasses COMPANY, BANK, and PERSON
    *   A category member must exist in *at least one (typically just one)* of its superclasses
*   Difference from *shared subclass*, which is a:
    *   subset of the *intersection* of its superclasses
    *   shared subclass member must exist in *all* of its superclasses
