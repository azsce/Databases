<div class="page-break"></div>

## Introduction

*   **Distributed computing system**
    *   Consists of several processing sites or nodes interconnected by a computer network
    *   Nodes cooperate in performing certain tasks
    *   Partitions large task into smaller tasks for efficient solving
*   **Big data technologies**
    *   Combine distributed and database technologies
    *   Deal with mining vast amounts of data

## 23.1 Distributed Database Concepts

*   What constitutes a distributed database?
    *   Connection of database nodes over computer network
    *   Logical interrelation of the connected databases
    *   Possible absence of homogeneity among connected nodes
*   **Distributed database management system (DDBMS)**
    *   Software system that manages a distributed database

---

### Distributed Database Concepts (cont'd.)

*   **Local area network**
    *   Hubs or cables connect sites
*   **Long-haul or wide area network**
    *   Telephone lines, cables, wireless, or satellite connections
*   Network topology defines communication path
*   **Transparency**
    *   Hiding implementation details from the end user

---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Transparency

*   **Types of transparency**
    *   **Data organization transparency**
        *   Hides how data is logically structured or physically stored. Users interact with data without needing to know its underlying organization (e.g., tables, partitions, or distributed storage).
    *   **Location transparency**: Users can access data without knowing its physical location (e.g., which server or node stores it).
    *   **Naming transparency**: Ensures that a unique name identifies each data item, regardless of its location. Avoids name conflicts in distributed environments.

---

*   **Types of transparency (cont'd)**
    *   **Replication transparency**
        *   Hides the fact that data may be replicated (stored in multiple locations). Users see a single copy, even if multiple copies exist for fault tolerance or performance.
    *   **Fragmentation transparency**
        *   Conceals how data is split (fragmented) across different nodes.
        *   Two types:
            *   **Horizontal fragmentation**: Rows of a table are distributed across different nodes (e.g., employees in different regions stored separately).
            *   **Vertical fragmentation**: Columns of a table are distributed (e.g., employees names in one node and addresses in another).

---

*   **Types of transparency (cont'd)**
    *   **Design transparency**
        *   Hides the complexities of how the distributed system was designed.
        *   Users and applications do not need to know about partitioning strategies or replication schemes.
    *   **Execution transparency**
        *   Conceals the details of how a distributed operation is executed across multiple nodes.
        *   Example: A distributed transaction appears as a single operation, even if it involves multiple servers.

## Availability and Reliability

*   **Availability**
    *   Probability that the system is continuously available during a time interval
*   **Reliability**
    *   Probability that the system is running (not down) at a certain time point
*   Both directly related to faults, errors, and failures

---

*   **Fault-tolerant approaches**
    *   **Replication**: Multiple copies of data ensure continuity if one node fails.
    *   **Redundancy**: Extra components (servers, networks) take over if primary ones fail.
    *   **Consensus Protocols**: Algorithms like Paxos or Raft ensure consistency even during failures.
    *   **Check pointing & Recovery**: Periodic snapshots allow quick recovery after crashes.

---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Scalability and Partition Tolerance

*   **Horizontal scalability**
    *   Expanding the number of nodes in a distributed system
*   **Vertical scalability**
    *   Expanding capacity of the individual nodes
*   **Partition tolerance**
    *   System should have the capacity to continue operating while the network is partitioned

---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Autonomy

*   Determines extent to which individual nodes can operate independently
*   **Design autonomy**
    *   Independence of data model usage and transaction management techniques among nodes
*   **Communication autonomy**
    *   Determines the extent to which each node can decide on sharing information with other nodes
*   **Execution autonomy**
    *   Independence of users to act as they please

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Advantages of Distributed Databases

*   Improved ease and flexibility of application development
    *   Development at geographically dispersed sites
*   Increased availability
    *   Isolate faults to their site of origin
*   Improved performance
    *   Data localization
*   Easier expansion via scalability
    *   Easier than in non-distributed systems

---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## 23.2 Data Fragmentation, Replication, and Allocation Techniques for Distributed Database Design

*   **Fragments**
    *   Logical units of the database
*   **Horizontal fragmentation (sharding)**
    *   Horizontal fragment or shard of a relation is a subset of the tuples in that relation
    *   Can be specified by condition on one or more attributes or by some other method
    *   Groups rows to create subsets of tuples
        *   Each subset has a certain logical meaning

---

### Data Fragmentation (cont'd.)

*   **Vertical fragmentation**
    *   Divides a relation vertically by columns
    *   Keeps only certain attributes of the relation
*   **Complete horizontal fragmentation**
    *   Apply `UNION` operation to the fragments to reconstruct relation
*   **Complete vertical fragmentation**
    *   Apply `OUTER UNION` or `FULL OUTER JOIN` operation to reconstruct relation

---

### Data Fragmentation (cont'd.)

*   **Mixed (hybrid) fragmentation**
    *   Combination of horizontal and vertical fragmentations
*   **Fragmentation schema**
    *   Defines a set of fragments that includes all attributes and tuples in the database
*   **Allocation schema**
    *   Describes the allocation of fragments to nodes of the DDBS

---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Data Replication and Allocation

*   **Fully replicated distributed database**
    *   Replication of whole database at every site in distributed system
    *   Improves availability remarkably
    *   Update operations can be slow
*   **Nonredundant allocation (no replication)**
    *   Each fragment is stored at exactly one site

---

### Data Replication and Allocation (cont'd.)

*   **Partial replication**
    *   Some fragments are replicated and others are not
    *   Defined by replication schema
*   **Data allocation (data distribution)**
    *   Each fragment assigned to a particular site in the distributed system
    *   Choices depend on performance and availability goals of the system

---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Example of Fragmentation, Allocation, and Replication

*   Company with three computer sites
    *   One for each department
    *   Expect frequent access by employees working in the department and projects controlled by that department
*   See Figures 23.2 and 23.3 in the text for example fragmentation among the three sites

## 23.3 Overview of Concurrency Control and Recovery in Distributed Databases

*   For concurrency control and recovery purposes, numerous problems arise in a distributed DBMS environment
    *   **Dealing with multiple copies of the data items**
        *   The concurrency control method is responsible for maintaining consistency among these copies.
    *   **Failure of individual sites**
        *   The DDBMS should continue to operate with its running sites, if possible, when one or more individual sites fail.

---

*   **Overview of Concurrency Control and Recovery in Distributed Databases (cont'd)**
    *   **Failure of communication links**
        *   The system must be able to deal with the failure of one or more of the communication links that connect the sites.
    *   **Distributed commit**
        *   Problems can arise with committing a transaction that is accessing databases stored on multiple sites if some sites fail during the commit process. The two-phase commit protocol (see Section 21.6) is often used to deal with this problem.
    *   **Distributed deadlock**
        *   Deadlock may occur among several sites, so techniques for dealing with deadlocks must be extended to take this into account

---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Distributed Concurrency Control Based on a Distinguished Copy of a Data Item

To deal with replicated data items in a distributed database, a number of concurrency control methods have been proposed that extend the concurrency control techniques that are used in centralized databases. The idea is to designate a particular copy of each data item as a distinguished copy.

*   **Primary site technique**
    *   In this method, a single primary site is designated to be the coordinator site for all database items. Hence, all locks are kept at that site, and all requests for locking or unlocking are sent there.
    *   Disadvantages. One is that all locking requests are sent to a single site, possibly overloading that site and causing a system bottleneck. A second disadvantage is that failure of the primary site paralyzes the system.

---

*   **Distributed Concurrency Control Based on a Distinguished Copy of a Data Item (cont'd)**
    *   **Primary site with backup site**
        *   This approach addresses the second disadvantage of the primary site method by designating a second site to be a backup site. All locking information is maintained at both the primary and the backup sites. In case of primary site failure, the backup site takes over as the primary site, and a new backup site is chosen.
    *   **Disadvantages.** It slows down the process of acquiring locks, however, because all lock requests and granting of locks must be recorded at both the primary and the backup sites before a response is sent to the requesting transaction.

---

*   **Distributed Concurrency Control Based on a Distinguished Copy of a Data Item (cont'd)**
    *   **Primary copy method**
        *   This method attempts to distribute the load of lock coordination among various sites by having the distinguished copies of different data items stored at different sites.
        *   Failure of one site affects any transactions that are accessing locks on items whose primary copies reside at that site, but other transactions are not affected.

---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Distributed Concurrency Control Based on Voting

*   **Voting method**
    *   No distinguished copy
    *   Lock requests sent to all sites that contain a copy
    *   Each copy maintains its own lock
    *   If transaction that requests a lock is granted that lock by a majority of the copies, it holds the lock on all copies
    *   If a transaction does not receive a majority of votes granting it a lock within a certain time-out period, it cancels its request and informs all sites of the cancellation.
    *   Time-out period applies
    *   **Disadvantage**: Results in higher message traffic among sites

---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Distributed Recovery

*   Difficult to determine whether a site is down without exchanging numerous messages with other sites
*   **Distributed commit**
    *   When a transaction is updating data at several sites, it cannot commit until certain its effect on every site cannot be lost
    *   Two-phase commit protocol often used to ensure correctness

---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## 23.4 Overview of Transaction Management in Distributed Databases

*   **Global transaction manager**
    *   Supports distributed transactions
    *   Role temporarily assumed by site at which transaction originated
        *   Coordinates execution with transaction managers at multiple sites
    *   Passes database operations and associated information to the concurrency controller
        *   Controller responsible for acquisition and release of locks

---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Commit Protocols

*   **Two-phase**
    *   Coordinator maintains information needed for recovery
        *   In addition to local recovery managers
*   **Three-phase**
    *   Divides second commit phase into two subphases
        *   Prepare-to-commit phase communicates result of the vote phase
        *   Commit subphase same as two-phase commit counterpart

---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## 23.5 Query Processing and Optimization in Distributed Databases

*   **Stages of a distributed database query**
    *   **Query mapping**
        *   Refers to global conceptual schema
    *   **Localization**
        *   Maps the distributed query to separate queries on individual fragments
    *   **Global query optimization**
        *   Strategy selected from list of candidates
    *   **Local query optimization**
        *   Common to all sites in the DDB

---

### Query Processing and Optimization in Distributed Databases (cont'd.)

*   **Data transfer costs of distributed query processing**
    *   Cost of transferring intermediate and final result files
*   **Optimization criterion**: reducing amount of data transfer

---

### Query Processing and Optimization in Distributed Databases (cont'd.)

*   **Distributed query processing using semijoin**
    *   Reduces the number of tuples in a relation before transferring it to another site
    *   Send the joining column of one relation R to one site where the other relation S is located
    *   Join attributes and result attributes shipped back to original site
    *   Efficient solution to minimizing data transfer

---

### Query Processing and Optimization in Distributed Databases (cont'd.)

*   **Query and update decomposition**
    *   User can specify a query as if the DBMS were centralized
        *   If full distribution, fragmentation, and replication transparency are supported
    *   **Query decomposition module**
        *   Breaks up a query into subqueries that can be executed at the individual sites
        *   Strategy for combining results must be generated
    *   Catalog stores attribute list and/or guard condition

        *   Homogeneous
        *   Heterogeneous
