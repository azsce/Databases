### More SQL: Complex Queries, Triggers, Views, and Schema Modification


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Chapter 7 Outline
*   More Complex SQL Retrieval Queries
*   Specifying Semantic Constraints as Assertions and Actions as Triggers
*   Views (Virtual Tables) in SQL
*   Schema Modification in SQL


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## More Complex SQL Retrieval Queries
*   Additional features allow users to specify more complex retrievals from database:
    *   Nested queries, joined tables, and outer joins (in the `FROM` clause), aggregate functions, and grouping


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Comparisons Involving NULL and Three-Valued Logic
*   Meanings of `NULL`
    *   **Unknown value**
    *   **Unavailable or withheld value**
    *   **Not applicable attribute**
*   Each individual `NULL` value considered to be different from every other `NULL` value
*   SQL uses a three-valued logic:
    *   `TRUE`, `FALSE`, and `UNKNOWN` (like Maybe)
*   `NULL = NULL` comparison is avoided

<div class="page-break"></div>

### Comparisons Involving NULL and Three-Valued Logic (cont'd.)
*   SQL allows queries that check whether an attribute value is `NULL`
    *   `IS` or `IS NOT NULL`

**Query 18.** Retrieve the names of all employees who do not have supervisors.
```sql
Q18:
SELECT   Fname, Lname
FROM     EMPLOYEE
WHERE    Super_ssn IS NULL;
```


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Nested Queries, Tuples, and Set/Multiset Comparisons
*   **Nested queries**
    *   Complete select-from-where blocks within `WHERE` clause of another query
    *   **Outer query and nested subqueries**
*   Comparison operator `IN`
    *   Compares value `v` with a set (or multiset) of values `V`
    *   Evaluates to `TRUE` if `v` is one of the elements in `V`


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

### Nested Queries (cont'd.)
Make a list of all project numbers for projects that involve employee Smith either as worker or as a manager of the department that controls the project:
```sql
Q4A:
SELECT   DISTINCT Pnumber
FROM     PROJECT
WHERE    Pnumber IN
             (SELECT  Pnumber
              FROM    PROJECT, DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE
              WHERE   Dnum=Dnumber AND
                      Mgr_ssn=Ssn AND Lname='Smith')
         OR
         Pnumber IN
             (SELECT  Pno
              FROM    WORKS_ON, EMPLOYEE
              WHERE   Essn=Ssn AND Lname='Smith');
```


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

### Nested Queries (cont'd.)
*   Use tuples of values in comparisons
    *   Place them within parentheses
```sql
SELECT   DISTINCT Essn
FROM     WORKS_ON
WHERE    (Pno, Hours) IN (SELECT Pno, Hours
                           FROM   WORKS_ON
                           WHERE  Essn='123456789');
```


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

### Nested Queries (cont'd.)
*   Use other comparison operators to compare a single value `v`
    *   `= ANY` (or `= SOME`) operator [equivalent to `IN`]
        *   Returns `TRUE` if the value `v` is equal to some value in the set
*   Other operators that can be combined with `ANY` (or `SOME`): `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, and `<>`
*   `ALL`: value must exceed all values from nested query
```sql
SELECT   Lname, Fname
FROM     EMPLOYEE
WHERE    Salary > ALL (SELECT Salary
                       FROM   EMPLOYEE
                       WHERE  Dno=5);
```


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## General Form of ALL, ANY, SOME
```sql
SELECT [column_name]
FROM [table_name]
WHERE expression operator
      {ALL | ANY | SOME} (subquery)
```


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

### Nested Queries (cont'd.)
*   Avoid potential errors and ambiguities
    *   Create tuple variables (aliases) for all tables referenced in SQL query

**Query 16.** Retrieve the name of each employee who has a dependent with the same first name and is the same sex as the employee.
```sql
Q16:
SELECT   E.Fname, E.Lname
FROM     EMPLOYEE AS E
WHERE    E.Ssn IN (SELECT Essn
                   FROM   DEPENDENT AS D
                   WHERE  E.Fname=D.Dependent_name
                          AND E.Sex=D.Sex);
```


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

### Understanding a nested (correlated) query

**Query 16.** Retrieve the name of each employee who has a dependent with the same first name and is the same sex as the employee.
```sql
Q16:
SELECT   E.Fname, E.Lname
FROM     EMPLOYEE AS E
WHERE    E.Ssn IN (SELECT Essn
                   FROM   DEPENDENT AS D
                   WHERE  E.Fname=D.Dependent_name
                          AND E.Sex=D.Sex);
```
For each E tuple,
Evaluate the nested query
which retrieves the Essn values of all D tuples
with the same sex and name as E tuple
If the Ssn value of E tuple is in the result,
then select the E tuple


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Correlated Nested Queries
*   Queries that are nested using the `=` or `IN` comparison operator can be collapsed into one single block: E.g., Q16 can be written as:
```sql
Q16A:
SELECT   E.Fname, E.Lname
FROM     EMPLOYEE AS E, DEPENDENT AS D
WHERE    E.Ssn=D.Essn AND E.Sex=D.Sex AND
         E.Fname=D.Dependent_name;
```
*   **Correlated nested query**
    *   Evaluated once for each tuple in the outer query


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## The EXISTS and UNIQUE Functions in SQL for correlating queries
*   `EXISTS` function
    *   Check whether the result of a correlated nested query is empty or not. They are Boolean functions that return a `TRUE` or `FALSE` result.
*   `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS`
    *   Typically used in conjunction with a correlated nested query
*   SQL function `UNIQUE (Q)`
    *   Returns `TRUE` if there are no duplicate tuples in the result of query Q


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## USE of EXISTS
List the managers who have at least one dependent
```sql
Q7:
SELECT Fname, Lname
FROM Employee
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT *
              FROM DEPENDENT
              WHERE Ssn=Essn)
      AND EXISTS (SELECT *
                  FROM Department
                  WHERE Ssn=Mgr_Ssn)
```


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Explicit Sets and Renaming of Attributes in SQL
*   Can use explicit set of values in `WHERE` clause
```sql
Q17:
SELECT   DISTINCT Essn
FROM     WORKS_ON
WHERE    Pno IN (1, 2, 3);
```
*   Use qualifier `AS` followed by desired new name
    *   Rename any attribute that appears in the result of a query
```sql
Q8A:
SELECT   E.Lname AS Employee_name, S.Lname AS Supervisor_name
FROM     EMPLOYEE AS E, EMPLOYEE AS S
WHERE    E.Super_ssn=S.Ssn;
```


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Specifying Joined Tables in the FROM Clause of SQL
*   **Joined table**
    *   Permits users to specify a table resulting from a join operation in the `FROM` clause of a query
*   The `FROM` clause in Q1A
    *   Contains a single joined table. `JOIN` may also be called `INNER JOIN`
```sql
Q1A:
SELECT   Fname, Lname, Address
FROM     (EMPLOYEE JOIN DEPARTMENT ON Dno=Dnumber)
WHERE    Dname='Research';
```


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Different Types of JOINed Tables in SQL
*   Specify different types of join
    *   `NATURAL JOIN`
    *   Various types of `OUTER JOIN` (`LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL`)
*   `NATURAL JOIN` on two relations R and S
    *   No join condition specified
    *   Is equivalent to an implicit `EQUIJOIN` condition for each pair of attributes with same name from R and S


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## NATURAL JOIN
*   Rename attributes of one relation so it can be joined with another using `NATURAL JOIN`:
```sql
Q1B:
SELECT   Fname, Lname, Address
FROM     (EMPLOYEE NATURAL JOIN
          (DEPARTMENT AS DEPT (Dname, Dno, Mssn, Msdate)))
WHERE    Dname='Research';
```
The above works with `EMPLOYEE.Dno = DEPT.Dno` as an implicit join condition


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## INNER and OUTER Joins
*   `INNER JOIN` (versus `OUTER JOIN`)
    *   Default type of join in a joined table
    *   Tuple is included in the result only if a matching tuple exists in the other relation
*   `LEFT OUTER JOIN`
    *   Every tuple in left table must appear in result
    *   If no matching tuple
        *   Padded with `NULL` values for attributes of right table
*   `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`
    *   Every tuple in right table must appear in result
    *   If no matching tuple
        *   Padded with `NULL` values for attributes of left table


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Aggregate Functions in SQL
*   Used to summarize information from multiple tuples into a single-tuple summary
*   Built-in aggregate functions
    *   `COUNT`, `SUM`, `MAX`, `MIN`, and `AVG`
*   **Grouping**
    *   Create subgroups of tuples before summarizing
*   To select entire groups, `HAVING` clause is used
*   Aggregate functions can be used in the `SELECT` clause or in a `HAVING` clause


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Renaming Results of Aggregation
*   Following query returns a single row of computed values from `EMPLOYEE` table:

```sql
Q19:
SELECT SUM (Salary), MAX (Salary), MIN (Salary), AVG (Salary)
FROM   EMPLOYEE;
```

*   The result can be presented with new names:
  
```sql
Q19A:
SELECT SUM (Salary) AS Total_Sal, MAX (Salary) AS Highest_Sal,
       MIN (Salary) AS Lowest_Sal, AVG (Salary) AS Average_Sal
FROM   EMPLOYEE;
```


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

### Aggregate Functions in SQL (cont'd.)
*   `NULL` values are discarded when aggregate functions are applied to a particular column

**Query 20.** Find the sum of the salaries of all employees of the ‘Research’ department, as well as the maximum salary, the minimum salary, and the average salary in this department.
```sql
Q20:
SELECT   SUM (Salary), MAX (Salary), MIN (Salary), AVG (Salary)
FROM     (EMPLOYEE JOIN DEPARTMENT ON Dno=Dnumber)
WHERE    Dname='Research';
```
**Queries 21 and 22.** Retrieve the total number of employees in the company (Q21) and the number of employees in the ‘Research’ department (Q22).
```sql
Q21:
SELECT   COUNT (*)
FROM     EMPLOYEE;

Q22:
SELECT   COUNT (*)
FROM     EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT
WHERE    DNO=DNUMBER AND DNAME='Research';
```


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Grouping: The GROUP BY Clause
*   **Partition** relation into subsets of tuples
    *   Based on **grouping attribute(s)**
    *   Apply function to each such group independently
*   `GROUP BY` clause
    *   Specifies grouping attributes
*   `COUNT (*)` counts the number of rows in the group


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Examples of GROUP BY
*   The grouping attribute must appear in the `SELECT` clause:
```sql
Q24:
SELECT   Dno, COUNT (*), AVG (Salary)
FROM     EMPLOYEE
GROUP BY Dno;
```
*   If the grouping attribute has `NULL` as a possible value, then a separate group is created for the null value (e.g., null Dno in the above query)
*   `GROUP BY` may be applied to the result of a `JOIN`:
```sql
Q25:
SELECT   Pnumber, Pname, COUNT (*)
FROM     PROJECT, WORKS_ON
WHERE    Pnumber=Pno
GROUP BY Pnumber, Pname;
```


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Grouping: The GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses (cont'd.)
*   `HAVING` clause
    *   Provides a condition to select or reject an entire group:

**Query 26.** For each project on which *more than two employees work*, retrieve the project number, the project name, and the number of employees who work on the project.
```sql
Q26:
SELECT   Pnumber, Pname, COUNT (*)
FROM     PROJECT, WORKS_ON
WHERE    Pnumber=Pno
GROUP BY Pnumber, Pname
HAVING   COUNT (*) > 2;
```


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Combining the WHERE and the HAVING Clause
*   Consider the query: we want to count the *total* number of employees whose salaries exceed $40,000 in each department, but only for departments where more than five employees work.
*   **INCORRECT QUERY:**
```sql
SELECT   Dno, COUNT (*)
FROM     EMPLOYEE
WHERE    Salary>40000
GROUP BY Dno
HAVING   COUNT (*) > 5;
```


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

### Combining the WHERE and the HAVING Clause (continued)
**Correct Specification of the Query:**
*   Note: the `WHERE` clause applies tuple by tuple whereas `HAVING` applies to entire group of tuples

**Query 28.** For each department that has more than five employees, retrieve the department number and the number of its employees who are making more than $40,000.
```sql
Q28:
SELECT   Dnumber, COUNT (*)
FROM     DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE
WHERE    Dnumber=Dno AND Salary>40000 AND
         Dno IN (SELECT Dno
                 FROM   EMPLOYEE
                 GROUP BY Dno
                 HAVING COUNT (*) > 5)
GROUP BY Dnumber; 
```
*Editor's note: The provided query in the slide for Q28 has a slight logical issue in how it combines the conditions. A more direct way to write this, or an alternative interpretation, might be:*
```sql
/* Alternative interpretation or more direct way for Q28: */
SELECT E.Dno, COUNT(*)
FROM EMPLOYEE E
WHERE E.Salary > 40000
GROUP BY E.Dno
HAVING COUNT(*) > (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM EMPLOYEE E2 WHERE E2.Dno = E.Dno AND COUNT(DISTINCT E2.Ssn) > 5 );
/* Or more commonly: */
SELECT Dno, COUNT(*)
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE Salary > 40000 AND Dno IN (SELECT Dno
                                  FROM EMPLOYEE
                                  GROUP BY Dno
                                  HAVING COUNT(*) > 5)
GROUP BY Dno;
```
**Query 28. (as intended by slide, assuming `IN` operator was implied for the subquery condition)**
```sql
Q28:
SELECT   Dnumber, COUNT (*)
FROM     DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE
WHERE    Dnumber=Dno AND Salary>40000 AND
         Dno IN (SELECT   Dno
                 FROM     EMPLOYEE
                 GROUP BY Dno
                 HAVING   COUNT (*) > 5)
GROUP BY Dnumber;
```

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Use of CASE
*   SQL also has a `CASE` construct
*   Used when a value can be different based on certain conditions.
*   Can be used in any part of an SQL query where a value is expected
*   Applicable when querying, inserting or updating tuples


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## EXAMPLE of use of CASE
*   The following example shows that employees are receiving different raises in different departments (A variation of the update U6)
```sql
U6':
UPDATE EMPLOYEE
SET    Salary =
       CASE
           WHEN Dno = 5 THEN Salary + 2000
           WHEN Dno = 4 THEN Salary + 1500
           WHEN Dno = 1 THEN Salary + 3000
       END; 
       /* Note: Added END; for completeness, standard SQL CASE requires an END.
          Optionally, an ELSE clause can be added. Without ELSE, if no WHEN condition is met,
          the result is NULL by default, which would set Salary to NULL for other departments.
          To keep existing salary for others:
          ELSE Salary
          END;
       */
```
*Slide presented an incomplete CASE statement, typical SQL would require `END`. If the intention is only to update these departments and leave others unchanged, the `UPDATE` statement would need a `WHERE Dno IN (1, 4, 5)` clause, and the `CASE` would look as shown. Without a `WHERE` clause on the `UPDATE`, an `ELSE Salary` within the `CASE` is crucial if salaries for other departments should remain unchanged.*

Corrected for standard SQL, assuming intent is to only change salaries for Dno 1, 4, 5 and leave others as is:
```sql
U6':
UPDATE EMPLOYEE
SET    Salary =
       CASE
           WHEN Dno = 5 THEN Salary + 2000
           WHEN Dno = 4 THEN Salary + 1500
           WHEN Dno = 1 THEN Salary + 3000
           ELSE Salary  -- Keeps salary unchanged for other Dnos
       END;
```
Or, if only specific departments are to be updated:
```sql
U6':
UPDATE EMPLOYEE
SET    Salary =
       CASE
           WHEN Dno = 5 THEN Salary + 2000
           WHEN Dno = 4 THEN Salary + 1500
           WHEN Dno = 1 THEN Salary + 3000
       END
WHERE Dno IN (1, 4, 5);
```

## EXPANDED Block Structure of SQL Queries
```sql
SELECT <attribute and function list>
FROM <table list>
[ WHERE <condition> ]
[ GROUP BY <grouping attribute(s)> ]
[ HAVING <group condition> ]
[ ORDER BY <attribute list> ];
```


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Specifying Constraints as Assertions and Actions as Triggers
*   Semantic Constraints: The following are beyond the scope of the EER and relational model
*   `CREATE ASSERTION`
    *   Specify additional types of constraints outside scope of built-in relational model constraints
*   `CREATE TRIGGER`
    *   Specify automatic actions that database system will perform when certain events and conditions occur


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Specifying General Constraints as Assertions in SQL
*   `CREATE ASSERTION`
    *   Specify a query that selects any tuples that violate the desired condition
    *   Use only in cases where it goes beyond a simple `CHECK` which applies to individual attributes and domains
*   Salary of an employee must be less than the manager
```sql
CREATE ASSERTION SALARY_CONSTRAINT
CHECK (NOT EXISTS (SELECT *
                   FROM   EMPLOYEE E, EMPLOYEE M, DEPARTMENT D
                   WHERE  E.Salary > M.Salary
                          AND E.Dno = D.Dnumber
                          AND D.Mgr_ssn = M.Ssn));
```


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Introduction to Triggers in SQL
*   `CREATE TRIGGER` statement
    *   Used to monitor the database
*   Typical trigger has three components which make it a rule for an "active database " (more on active databases in section 26.1) :
    *   **Event(s)**
    *   **Condition**
    *   **Action**


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## USE OF TRIGGERS
*   AN EXAMPLE with standard Syntax. (Note : other SQL implementations like PostgreSQL use a different syntax.)
```sql
R5:
CREATE TRIGGER SALARY_VIOLATION
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OF Salary, Supervisor_ssn ON EMPLOYEE
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN (NEW.SALARY > (SELECT Salary FROM EMPLOYEE
                    WHERE Ssn = NEW.Supervisor_Ssn))
INFORM_SUPERVISOR (NEW.Supervisor.Ssn, NEW.Ssn) 
/* Note: INFORM_SUPERVISOR is a hypothetical procedure.
   Standard SQL might use SIGNAL SQLSTATE or call a stored procedure.
   Also, NEW.Supervisor.Ssn is likely a typo in the slide, it should probably be NEW.Supervisor_Ssn,
   assuming Supervisor_Ssn is the column name in the EMPLOYEE table for the new/updated row.
   The SELECT subquery condition should be Supervisor_Ssn, not Supervisor.Ssn or Supervisor_Ssn of the supervisor.
   Let's re-evaluate the original image for R5.
   The OCR says: `WHERE Ssn = NEW. Supervisor_Ssn`
   The INFORM_SUPERVISOR line says: `(NEW.Supervisor.Ssn, New.Ssn)`
   Assuming `Supervisor_Ssn` is the attribute in `EMPLOYEE` table that stores the SSN of the supervisor.
   The `NEW.Supervisor.Ssn` in `INFORM_SUPERVISOR` is problematic. It should be `NEW.Supervisor_Ssn`.
*/
```

Revised based on typical SQL trigger structure and correcting potential typos:

```sql
R5:
CREATE TRIGGER SALARY_VIOLATION
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OF Salary, Supervisor_ssn ON EMPLOYEE
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN (NEW.SALARY > (SELECT Salary FROM EMPLOYEE
                    WHERE Ssn = NEW.Supervisor_Ssn)) -- Assuming Supervisor_Ssn refers to the supervisor's Ssn in the EMPLOYEE table
-- The action part 'INFORM_SUPERVISOR' is conceptual.
-- In standard SQL, this would typically call a stored procedure or raise an error.
-- For example:
-- BEGIN
--    CALL inform_supervisor_procedure(NEW.Supervisor_Ssn, NEW.Ssn);
-- END;
-- Or:
-- SIGNAL SQLSTATE 'value' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Salary cannot exceed supervisor salary';

-- As per slide, using the placeholder:
INFORM_SUPERVISOR (NEW.Supervisor_Ssn, NEW.Ssn); -- Corrected NEW.Supervisor.Ssn to NEW.Supervisor_Ssn
```

## Views (Virtual Tables) in SQL
*   Concept of a view in SQL
    *   Single table derived from other tables called the **defining tables**
    *   Considered to be a virtual table that is not necessarily populated


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Specification of Views in SQL
*   `CREATE VIEW` command
    *   Give table name, list of attribute names, and a query to specify the contents of the view
*   In V1, attributes retain the names from base tables. In V2, attributes are assigned names

```sql
V1:

### Specification of Views in SQL (cont'd.)
*   Once a View is defined, SQL queries can use the View relation in the `FROM` clause
*   View is always up-to-date
    *   Responsibility of the DBMS and not the user
*   `DROP VIEW` command
    *   Dispose of a view

## Schema Change Statements in SQL
*   **Schema evolution commands**
    *   DBA may want to change the schema while the database is operational
    *   Does not require recompilation of the database schema


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## The DROP Command
*   `DROP` command
    *   Used to drop named schema elements, such as tables, domains, or constraint
*   Drop behavior options:
    *   `CASCADE` and `RESTRICT`
*   Example:
    *   `DROP SCHEMA COMPANY CASCADE;`
    *   This removes the schema and all its elements including tables, views, constraints, etc.
    *   `RESTRICT`: drops only if it has no dependent objects (or "nothing in it" as per slide's simplification).

<div class="page-break"></div>

## The ALTER table command
*   **Alter table actions** include:
    *   Adding or dropping a column (attribute)
    *   Changing a column definition
    *   Adding or dropping table constraints
*   Example:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE COMPANY.EMPLOYEE ADD
    COLUMN Job VARCHAR(12);
    ```


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Adding and Dropping Constraints
*   Change constraints specified on a table
    *   Add or drop a named constraint
```sql
ALTER TABLE COMPANY.EMPLOYEE
DROP CONSTRAINT EMPSUPERFK CASCADE;
```


---
<div class="page-break"></div>

## Dropping Columns, Default Values
*   To drop a column
    *   Choose either `CASCADE` or `RESTRICT`
    *   `CASCADE` would drop the column from views etc.
    *   `RESTRICT` is possible if no views refer to it.
```sql
ALTER TABLE COMPANY.EMPLOYEE DROP COLUMN
Address CASCADE;
```
*   Default values can be dropped and altered :
```sql
ALTER TABLE COMPANY.DEPARTMENT ALTER COLUMN Mgr_ssn
DROP DEFAULT;

ALTER TABLE COMPANY.DEPARTMENT ALTER COLUMN Mgr_ssn SET
DEFAULT '333445555';
```

### Table 7.2 Summary of SQL Syntax

**Table 7.2 Summary of SQL Syntax**

```sql
-- Create Table
CREATE TABLE <table_name> (
    <column_name> <column_type> [<attribute_constraint>],
    <column_name> <column_type> [<attribute_constraint>],
    ...
    [<table_constraint>, <table_constraint>, ...]
);

-- Drop Table
DROP TABLE <table_name>;

-- Alter Table - Add Column
ALTER TABLE <table_name> 
ADD <column_name> <column_type>;

-- Select Statement
SELECT [DISTINCT] <attribute_list>
FROM (
    <table_name> [<alias>] 
    | <joined_table>
), (
    <table_name> [<alias>] 
    | <joined_table>
), ...
[WHERE <condition>]
[GROUP BY <grouping_attributes> [HAVING <group_selection_condition>]]
[ORDER BY <column_name> [<order>] {, <column_name> [<order>]}];

-- Attribute List Definition
-- Can include all columns (*) or specific functions/columns
<attribute_list> ::= (
    * 
    | <column_name> 
    | <function>([DISTINCT] <column_name> | *) 
    {, <column_name> | <function>([DISTINCT] <column_name> | *) }
);

-- Grouping Attributes
<grouping_attributes> ::= <column_name> {, <column_name>};

-- Order Options
<order> ::= ASC | DESC;

-- Insert Statement
INSERT INTO <table_name> 
[ ( <column_name>, <column_name>, ... ) ]
VALUES 
    ( <constant_value>, <constant_value>, ... ),
    ( <constant_value>, <constant_value>, ... )
| <select_statement>;

-- Delete Rows from a Table
DELETE FROM <table_name>
[WHERE <selection_condition>];

-- Update Rows in a Table
UPDATE <table_name>
SET 
    <column_name> = <value_expression>,
    <column_name> = <value_expression>,
    ...
[WHERE <selection_condition>];

-- Create an Index
CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX <index_name>
ON <table_name> (
    <column_name> [<order>],
    <column_name> [<order>],
    ...
)
[CLUSTER];

-- Drop an Index
DROP INDEX <index_name>;

-- Create a View
CREATE VIEW <view_name> 
[ ( <column_name>, <column_name>, ... ) ]
AS <select_statement>;

-- Drop a View
DROP VIEW <view_name>;
```

NOTE: The commands for creating and dropping indexes are not part of standard SQL.

## Summary
*   **Complex SQL:**
    *   Nested queries, joined tables (in the `FROM` clause), outer joins, aggregate functions, grouping
*   Handling semantic constraints with `CREATE ASSERTION` and `CREATE TRIGGER`
*   `CREATE VIEW` statement and materialization strategies
*   Schema Modification for the DBAs using `ALTER TABLE`, `ADD` and `DROP COLUMN`, `ALTER CONSTRAINT` etc.
